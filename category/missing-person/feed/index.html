<p>In recent weeks, U.S. marshals have recovered 72 survivors of sex trafficking in Indiana, Ohio, and Georgia during “Operation Homecoming” in tandem with a string of similar operations occurring throughout the United States. The operation concludes within children from a wide age range being rescued from dangerous criminals who intend to traffic these children with intent to exploit throughout the United States and the globe.</p>



<p>Americans are obsessed with true crime material, particularly those concerning missing children, like the popular Netflix docuseries The Disappearance of Madeline McCann. Due to their sensational narratives, these cases typically revolve around conspiracy within or adjacent to the family. Missing children experts have also said that in a majority of cases, these children are abducted by someone they know rather than a stranger. The reality is that the danger comes from both strangers and family members who sold children into this form of modern-day slavery. Because cases of sex trafficking are not often reported on in extensive detail, social justice warriors have taken to&nbsp; creating hashtags to spread awareness. Among these is the hashtag #SaveOurChildren which seeks to bring awareness to sex trafficking and the pervasive cloak of criminal conspiracy under which it supposedly thrives. From claims that the furniture company Wayfair was selling children by disguising them as cabinets on the website to claims that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are aiding or abetting sex traffickers by allowing access to record numbers of displaced children, awareness of the machinations of sex trafficking are becoming a more tangible fear for many Americans. In Indiana particularly, learning how pervasive sex trafficking in Indiana has been and continues to be can be a difficult reality for those who previously thought of their state as a safe Midwestern state to live and thrive.</p>



<p>Professionals across multiple disciplines and capacities, including medicine, social services, and the criminal justice come across survivors of sex trafficking in Indiana at a much needed, if overdue point of intervention. This leaves many professionals and advocates at a loss, as they only have a limited role in preventing sex trafficking before it happens. Kalyani Gopal, the founder and president of SAFE Coalition for Human Rights recently told the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/opinion/ct-ptb-davich-child-sex-trafficking-victims-safe-village-st-0831-20200828-4d3hbrxd4rblvo6g7zxf56pa7q-story.html">Chicago Tribune</a>, “There is significant underreporting in Indiana&nbsp; due to a lack of training and awareness among first responders. Trafficking victims do not identify as being trafficked for many reasons, Mostly, they see themselves as being with a boyfriend or being used by a family for paying bills.” The reality is that in many of these situations, the “boyfriend” is actually a pimp exploiting the survivor through manipulation and violence. Survivors of sex trafficking in Indiana have often previously been subjected to molestation, domestic violence, and extreme poverty, leaving them with few options or cognitive tools to recognize a pattern of abuse and report it to authorities. This tracks with a Fox59 report from 2019 that states Indiana was one of only 20 states in the country that had no new criminal sex trafficking cases pending in the criminal court system. However, experts and advocates alike agree that this is not indicative of a fall in sex trafficking in Indiana. Kyleigh Feehs of the Associate Legal Counsel for the Human Trafficking Institute said in a public statement,</p>



<p>“There’s no evidence that shows that trafficking in the U.S. has dropped so the fact these prosecutions are dropping means there are more traffickers who are free to continue to exploit victims they have in their custody now as well as a future stream of victims. One of the most effective ways to combat trafficking is to prosecute traffickers, so this decline in cases is concerning ot us and we hope that this data will show that there’s a need to prioritize this issue and to dedicate, have dedicated investigators, and prosecutors who are working to stop traffickers.”</p>



<p>Indiana has been unflatteringly called “<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/opinion/ct-ptb-davich-child-sex-trafficking-safe-coalition-village-st-0907-20200904-q26tiwa6i5eflaewv37meg5z44-story.html">the armpit of the sex trafficking industry in the Midwest</a>.” The same set of circumstances that garnered the state motto “The Crossroads of America” makes Indiana a hotspot for sex traffickers. The proximity to the city of Chicago and major interstates that extend to the rest of the country make the path through Indiana unfortunately efficient to move survivors through, often undetected by law enforcement. By the time law enforcement becomes aware of any sex trafficking activity, traffickers may easily have slipped out of state and beyond their jurisdictional reach. Sex trafficking in Indiana is not only allowed to prevail under the binds of the state, but also through general apathy or horror. The inherent problem with combatting sex trafficking is that from law enforcement officials to private citizens, adults in the United States would rather ignore the problem with internal rationalizations involving the assumption that law and order successfully curbs these crimes coupled with general apathy and victim-blaming. In addition, the ever-evolving sophistication of sex traffickers, law enforcement also must work within a broken social system where endangered children and survivors constantly slip through the cracks. In Gopal’s words, “No community is immune.”</p>



<p>When it comes to missing children, sex trafficking is often one of the most horrifying culprits. Survivors of sex trafficking are particularly between 12 and 14 years of age, have been groomed over the internet, and have been lured from their homes into criminal clutches. Unfortunately, children who are reported missing by their families to law enforcement as “runaways” may not get the attention they deserve as endangered missing children—simply because runaways do not want to be found, and law enforcement often prioritizes time and resources elsewhere.</p>



<p>Sex trafficking is deeply exploitive for survivors, but they are not the only one effected by the horrors of sex trafficking. Their families are left twisting when law enforcement is unable to recover their endangered child from sex trafficking. That’s why many families turn to private investigators to find answers when their child goes missing. Private investigators carry similar skillsets to law enforcement in investigative methodology, surveillance technology, and fact-finding. Private investigators are typically self-employed and independent of any chain of command, which means they are not tethered by the same jurisdictional or bureaucratic red tape. This allows private investigators to follow leads from state to state as sex traffickers keep moving to evade law enforcement. Many private investigators are former law enforcement personnel who can assist police in a recovery effort once they’ve successfully located a missing child who has been trafficked.</p>



<p>Lauth Investigations International is a private investigation firm located in Indianapolis, Indiana. Their founder, Thomas Lauth, is <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/precious-time-hiring-private-investigator-locate-missing-teen/">one of the nation’s foremost experts in missing children.</a> For over 20 years, Lauth has been working with families of missing children, documenting the factors that led to them being coerced into sex trafficking, and assisting law enforcement in recovery operations to reunite survivors with their families. “It is very important for families to seek help independent from law enforcement in tandem with filing a police report. Unfortunately, law enforcement can be often unable or unwilling to help families of trafficked children because they see them as runaways. Having a private investigator involved at the onset of the case ensure that families with missing children have a greater chance of finding their missing children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/colorado-adoption.jpeg" alt="colorado-adoption" width="565" height="307" />As the Western idealization of a family unit continues to grow and change, more and more parents are either opting to place their child for adoption or adopt themselves rather than have a biological child. As such, adoptions are on the rise. </span><a href="https://adoptionnetwork.com/adoption-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Adoption Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates the number of children in foster care at any given time in the United States is around 428,000. Of that staggering number, about 135,000 are adopted every year. Children are put up for adoption under a wide umbrella of circumstances in varying degrees of frequency, but what is not uncommon is a child’s adolescent or adult curiosity about the exact nature of where they came from. Because adoption agencies have their own privacy restrictions regarding birth parents, adopted children are often left with only a few meager details and options. Private investigators, however, are well-equipped to find a child’s birth parents; with a comprehensive tool chest and a wealth of experience in searching for persons who may or may not want to be found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate at which information technology is developing has been denoted by some as Orwellian, but the ubiquity of public databases and fact-finding software available to the public is higher than ever. Hiring a private investigator may be costlier to the individual than conducting the search oneself, but without the proper tools and expertise, individuals can follow false leads and dead ends for years at the cost of their time and personal finances. Private investigators, especially ones who specialize in locating biological relatives, can cut down the time and expense individuals would ultimately incur during their search. The complexity of adoption laws and procedures (often varying state-to-state) is a knot of cable wires that is difficult for any private citizen to untangle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private investigators </span><a href="https://www.trustify.info/services/birth-child-or-birth-parent-locate-investigation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a variety of specialties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are suited for this work because there is no chain of command in their business. Most notably, private investigators are often their own bosses, with the freedom to pick and choose the cases they want to focus on. Unlike the underpaid, overworked civil servants who work in child services, or the overwhelmed agents at an adoption agency, private investigators only handle less than a half-dozen cases at one time, so an adoption case will not just become another folder in a tall, precariously leaning pile on someone’s desk. There are no jurisdictional boundaries preventing a private investigator from going across state lines, as long as they are licensed in the state or being contracted by a private investigator who is licensed in the state. While there are limitations to what information can be gathered from the state based on the birth-parents wishes, the autonomy of a private investigator is ideal for tracking down either birth parents, or children who have been placed for adoption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Child Welfare Information Gateway estimates, of all parents placing their biological children for adoption, nearly half of those parents will then seek out those children after they have reached adulthood. Parents in search of a biological child always have a search advantage as the legal adult at the time of the adoption. They play a pivotal role in establishing the boundaries that might preclude this child from ever contacting them again in the future. Depending on the terms of the adoption agreement, the adoption agency may not be able to release information about anonymous birth parents to their biological children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The privacy laws surrounding adoption in the United States date back to the beginning of the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, and were put in place to protect the privacy and identity of all parties involved in an adoption. It’s only in recent years that the </span><a href="https://www.trustify.info/services/birth-child-or-birth-parent-locate-investigation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adoption Information Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has made it possible for both parents and children to request information about the other in situations where all of the aforementioned parties have waived their right to privacy. Adoption laws have also gone through a metamorphosis in recent decades where parents are required to fill out detailed medical histories for the benefit of the child’s physical and mental health growing up. In addition to information about their own birth (date, location, hospital), a birth parent’s medical background might be the only information an adopted child possesses.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locating a birth parent or child is a form of investigation known as a skip trace. “Skip” refers to the action of searching for a person, derived from an old colloquialism, “to skip town,” or leave with very little notice or instruction. Trace refers to the process and resources involved in finding the person, such as international online databases, surveillance, and location technology and services. Skip traces in adoption cases can go both ways: A child in search of their birth parents, or a birth parent in search of the child they placed. Private investigators who take adoption skip traces have a mountain of data to sift through, including adoption registries, religion-related services (such as options offered through the Catholic church) and a mountain of databases, including—but not limited to—welfare, child protective services, private adoption agency, foster care, police, court, hospital, and international records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the level of information available to either a birth parent or biological child (and subsequently the investigator) adoption cases can have a mixed bag of possible results. In scenarios where a private investigator is unable to find a birth parent, it’s typically because there is not enough information on the record to begin with. Because of varying degrees of regulation across all adoption agencies (both state and private), the level of information and quality of record keeping is a crap-shoot, and investigators often hit dead ends in those types of investigations. In other circumstances, after many long hours of research and investigation, the private investigator is able to locate the birth child or parent, only to report back to the client the subject in question has no desire to reunite with them in any fashion. These are solutions often unsatisfactory to the client, but it is a difficult reality, and the client will have some semblance of closure regarding their questions about the subject. However, in the event private investigators locate the birth child or parent, and the subject is willing to re-initiate contact, private investigators can be ideal liaisons to bringing biological parents and children together in adulthood. They can alleviate some of the most common anxieties surrounding meeting strangers, and have experience with reconnecting displaced parties that will inform a gradual process of reestablishing contact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life has an infinite potential to get messy very quickly, and a child being placed for adoption is one of the consequences of the indeterminate. Fortunately, private investigators not only have the sleuth skills to find persons under all circumstances, but an acute ability to read people that benefits the precarious nature of the cases they take on. When a birth parent and child are open to meeting again under more pleasant circumstances, private investigators can build strong bridges across decades of separation, confusion, and curiosity. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1727" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kidnapping.jpg" alt="Kidnapping" width="668" height="373" />You receive a phone call and hear the voice of someone you don’t recognize. They tell you they have your child and will kill them unless you pay a ransom – they direct you not to call police or you will never see your child again.</p>
<p><strong>What would you do?</strong></p>
<p>You tell the person on the other end of the phone not to hang up. You don’t want to disconnect with the one person that can reunite you with your child. You plead for your child’s safe return. “Please don’t hurt her. I will do whatever you want,” you say. And, you would!</p>
<p>They demand you go to the bank and wire a ransom of several thousand dollars. Do you call the police? Do you pay the ransom and hope the thug will return your child to you safe?</p>
<p>A child going missing is every parent’s worst nightmare, and for those who do have a missing child &#8211; living with such ambiguity is said to be the most traumatic of human experiences.</p>
<p>Sounds like a situation that only happens in the movies, right? Or, something that only happens to the wealthiest people in society.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has declared virtual kidnapping a violent crime and issuing warnings to parents that scammers are targeting parents and demanding a ransom in exchange for the safe return of children they kidnapped . . . well, virtually kidnapped. Police throughout the country are following suit, issuing warnings in their communities.</p>
<p>Police throughout the country are following suit, issuing warnings in their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1976" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kid-1024x572.png" alt="kid" width="1024" height="572" /><strong>What is a Virtual Kidnapping?</strong></p>
<p>A virtual kidnapping scam is an attempt to dupe victims into paying a quick ransom. The virtual aspect of the scam involves staging a scene on the phone to convince a person that a loved one has been kidnapped, following with a demand for ransom.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, “The success of any type of virtual kidnapping scheme depends on speed and fear. Criminals know they only have a short time to exact a ransom before victims unravel the scam or authorities become involved.”</p>
<p>Typically, the scam is executed by calling a victim claiming they have kidnapped a loved one, then demand a ransom in exchange for the loved one’s safe return.</p>
<p>Valerie Sobel is one such person who did receive a call from a person who said, “We have your daughter’s finger. Pay up or you’ll get the rest of her body in a body bag.”</p>
<p>Petrified, Sobel rushed to a money transfer location to pay the ransom, wiring $4,000 to the person who claimed to have kidnapped her daughter.</p>
<p>Valerie made many frantic phone calls to her daughter’s cell phone and after many hours had passed, her daughter Simone called her back totally confused but safe.</p>
<p>Basically, scammers call random numbers hoping to find a person who they can convince, while other times these scammers research Facebook and other social media platforms for names and numbers. If a scammer calls 100 people, chances are at least one will instantly pay.</p>
<p>Another way it may go down is a scammer calls you and you hear a child crying, “Mom, please help me.” Panic immediately sets in. You think it is your child. Then a man’s voice comes on the phone and calls you by your first name. This legitimizes the caller and you immediately ask them to just tell you what they want. What mother would not empty her bank account in exchange for her child’s safety.</p>
<p>If you don’t think you could become a victim, please read on.</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, Wendy Mueller lives in historic Leesburg, Va., and never thought she would become a victim of a virtual kidnapping scam.</p>
<p>One afternoon, while standing at her kitchen sink, she received a call from a number she did not recognize but answered.</p>
<p>She heard screaming and it sounded like her 23-year old daughter’s voice begging for help.</p>
<p>Then a man’s voice tells her, “we have your daughter.”</p>
<p>The caller told Mueller to put her phone on speaker, get her purse and phone charger and get into the car.</p>
<p>The man asked, “How much cash can you get right now?”</p>
<p>$10,000,” Mueller replied.</p>
<p>The man told her not to contact anyone for help or they would kill her daughter.</p>
<p>Mueller’s daughter attends college hundreds of miles away and she had no way of knowing her daughter was safe.</p>
<p>“They told me they were actually targeting someone else, someone they would be able to get a lot of money for. But they said my daughter intervened when they tried to grab him. And that sounded exactly like something she would do,” Mueller said.</p>
<p>“I was terrified,” Mueller continued. “They told me they wouldn’t hesitate to kill her.”</p>
<p>The caller had told Mueller he had hacked her phone and knew every move she was making. For hours, he told her to go to small stores and offices across Northern Virginia, where she wired the max amount of usually $1,900 each time to names and addresses in Mexico that the caller had given Mueller.</p>
<p>Mueller cross-crossed the state following his directions and making payments, until nightfall came.</p>
<p>Mueller had kept asking to speak to her daughter.</p>
<p>“They kept promising me: ‘As soon as you send the last one, you will talk to her,’” Mueller said.</p>
<p>The caller told Mueller he was a professional and part of a group of kidnappers – a huge organization – who do this all the time and kill.</p>
<p>The man told Mueller they had placed a set of headphones on her daughter so she could hear everything, so her daughter would know if her mother did anything to cause her death.</p>
<p>Mueller thought of stopping passersby but didn’t want to chance the kidnapper knowing.</p>
<p>“It was torture,” Mueller said.</p>
<p>As it turned out, her daughter was in class, safe and sound. Mueller had been scammed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No one is immune</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of families throughout the country have become targets of these malicious scammers.</p>
<p>According to FBI kidnapping expert, Agent Eric Arbuthnot, several organizations use these scams regularly to make money.</p>
<p>“Thousands of dollars in ransom,” said Arbuthnot. “And you’re talking about a criminal organization that is capable of doing more than one kidnapping at a time.”</p>
<p>According to Arbuthnot many of the cases have been happening on the West coast and along the border involving criminal organizations from Mexico, some claiming to be members of the cartel.</p>
<p>The FBI has seen recent increases in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas and increasing on the east coast.</p>
<p>Monroe Police Department in Connecticut said by using social media, scammers can identify a victim, look up relatives, and reference names of family members and friends to make the call appear legitimate.</p>
<p>FBI Supervisory Agent Christopher Johnson said his office in St. Louis, Missouri, deals with these types of crimes. “Scammers will often mention specific facts about the parent or victim, likely from information they were able to obtain online.”</p>
<p>Authorities say about one in five kidnapping cases are successful resulting in the criminal getting their ransom and not getting caught. While extortion has been around for decades, virtual ransom kidnapping calls are increasing around the country.</p>
<p>With this emerging scam, the FBI has launched a nationwide campaign to warn parents to fight back against “virtual kidnapping.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike traditional kidnapping schemes, a “virtual kidnapper” has not actually kidnapped anyone. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation, if you receive a call from an individual demanding a ransom for the safe return of a kidnap victim, it is suggested you quickly evaluate the following to determine if you are receiving a legitimate ransom call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caller insists you stay on the phone.</li>
<li>Call does not come from your child’s cell phone.</li>
<li>Caller tries to stop you from contacting the kidnap victim.</li>
<li>Call includes demand for ransom to be paid via wire transfer.</li>
<li>Ransom amounts may decrease quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Knowing what to do</strong></p>
<p>Police say it is best to hang up the phone but:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you engage the caller, don’t call out your loved one’s name.</li>
<li>Deliberately try to slow the situation down and ask to speak to your child directly.</li>
<li>Ask “proof of life” questions like, “How do I know my loved one is okay?”</li>
<li>To gain confirmation if your child is an actual kidnapping victim, ask questions only your child would know such as the name of a pet.</li>
<li>Listen very closely to the voice of the person speaking, if possible record the call.</li>
<li>If possible, have someone else try to call your child’s cell phone, school, by text, social media, etc., to confirm their safety.</li>
<li>To buy time, repeat the caller’s request and tell them you are writing down the demand, or tell the caller you need time to make arrangements.</li>
<li>Don’t agree to pay a ransom, by wire or in person.</li>
<li>Don’t deliver money in person.</li>
<li>Immediately call your local FBI office and police.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), as of March 31, 2017, there were 86,618 active missing person cases in the FBI database, with 8, 792 entered as involuntary.</p>
<p>Experts agree that an actual kidnapping with a ransom demand is quite rare but all experts urge parents to be vigilant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1946" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PI-nita.jpg" alt="blending in private investigator" width="762" height="288" />According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2010, there were over 34,7000 licensed private investigators operating throughout the United States. The Bureau projects by 2020, the figure will increase twenty percent—resulting in almost 42,000 PIs. Though they may be great in number, you may  never spot one, because private investigators have a unique set of skills allowing them to blend in with all walks of society. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the average person thinks of a private investigator, it often evokes a handful of stereotyped images. Sherlock Holmes is one of the most famous private investigators in the global lexicon—even if he is fictional. In the United States, the film <em>noire</em> genre gave average citizens a staple look for PIs; long, tan trench coats, matching fedora hats, toting cameras with obnoxiously long lenses. More contemporary private sleuths are often thought of as being clad in all black and wearing dark sunglasses.  Because these images have permeated American culture, a private investigator fitting any of these descriptions can instantly have their covers blown. With a surge in surveillance culture and the ubiquity of technology and social media, private investigators in the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century must modify their investigative methods to adapt to a world where everyone is watching. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1947 " src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/468482500-612x612.jpg" alt="blending in in a crowd" width="986" height="658" /></p>
<p><b>Close, But Not Too Close</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in a world where individuals often have their eyes glued to a screen, it is easier than ever for a private investigator to have their cover blown while in the field. Rise in the saturation of crime coverage in both local and national media has citizens paying attention to their surroundings more than ever, especially when walking to and from their vehicles, and when developing a home security system. Despite concerns about the proverbial “Big Brother,” invading human privacy, the U.S. began to appreciate surveillance technology as a nation after a CCTV camera captured the perpetrators behind the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22274770"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Marathon bombing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the summer of 2013. Law enforcement investigating the tragedy were able to identify Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in a crowd of thousands, tracking every move they made until the fateful moment when they planted the two homemade pressure-cooker bombs killing three people and injuring hundreds more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the nation saw a rise in law enforcement agencies utilizing drones in their investigations, leading to a new wave of outrage and concern over the violation of privacy and spying. As of December 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/rise-in-us-police-use-of-drones-triggers-backlash-over-spying-and-other-abuses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 900 law enforcement agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were reported to use drones in their casework. This heightened awareness in the American population has forced private investigators to redefine their standards for proximity to a subject. Of course, a PI must be close enough to properly observe the subject, and despite their benefits, long camera lenses outside of large events inundated with press can just as likely be the aspect that blows a private investigator’s cover. Being too close to a subject can provoke them to confront the investigator and compromise the entire investigation. This obliterates future opportunities for surveillance and collection of evidence, as the subject will be on high-alert. </span></p>
<p><b>Do Your Homework </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to a stake-out or any form of field surveillance, private investigators must conduct extensive research about the area in order to move fluidly and avoid detection. Study of local businesses and restaurants can inform a private investigator what the public will be doing in the area, and increase their chances of successfully blending in with a crowd. In order to keep a low profile, PIs must place themselves in the mindset of a local. Places like coffee shops, restaurants, or shopping malls can be ideal places for surveillance, as there are built-in explanations for a person sitting or milling about without purpose for extended periods of time. In situations where this is not the case, it’s important for the investigator to have a method for making themselves appear occupied to cover their presence in an area. Luckily, a person staring at their phone for large blocks of time will raise no alarms with the subject or anyone else. Books, laptops, or accompaniment by an associate for “lunch” are also tried-and-true covers. Many private investigation periodicals </span><a href="https://www.pinow.com/articles/2462/how-to-not-be-spotted-a-private-investigator-s-guide-to-blending-in?signup_code=roundup&amp;mc_cid=c8034ad5f1&amp;mc_eid=ee24787a14"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducting as much online research as possible prior to surveillance in order to limit exposure. This means searching public databases, combing news articles, and scraping social media to arm oneself with as much information as possible.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1948" style="width: 1851px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1948" class="size-full wp-image-1948" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Joerg-Dsterwald-paints-model-allowing-her-to-blend-in-with-her-surroundings.jpg" alt="Blending in as a PI" width="1841" height="1227" /><p id="caption-attachment-1948" class="wp-caption-text">Blending in is the name of the game when you&#8217;re a private investigator.</p></div></p>
<p><b>Stealthy Sleuths </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, everyday citizens are more hypervigilant than ever. Subjects with a history in the criminal justice system or with law enforcement will be even more so. As such, the concept of tailing a subject is becoming less effective, resulting in the private investigator “getting made” by their target. Subjects will recognize the same face after multiple sightings, even if it is in a crowd, and strange vehicles parked in the same location for hours at a time are sure to draw suspicion. This is where thorough research with a private investigator’s client can become invaluable. Reconnaissance at the hands of a client can provide the investigator with information allowing them to be more inconspicuous when following a subject from location to location. For example, a spouse suspicious of infidelity can provide the private investigator with their spouse’s daily schedule—what time they wake up, their morning routine, addresses for their employment, frequent lunch locations, extra-curricular activities, the addresses of friends’ homes, the list goes on and on.</span></p>
<p><b>Competent Cover </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the most catlike of private investigators will have their covers blown from time to time. That’s why it’s imperative to have a bulletproof cover story. If they’ve done their research, private investigators can be ready with a plausible reason for being in the area, such as house-hunting, shopping, or just being plain lost and in need of direction. These quick explanations will cause a subject to lower their guard and reconsider their suspicion. Just as is the case with any deception, too many details pierce the veil. Being caught with surveillance equipment like cameras or microphones will also require explanation, but in a culture saturated with technology, this can also be easily explained. Camera drawing too much attention? Not if you’re a professional photographer on assignment. Microphone too conspicuous? It’s no longer a stretch to believe the average citizen is a fledgling podcaster or filmmaker recording </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post/what-18-common-sound-terms-actually-mean"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“foley” or “walla”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noise for their project. </span></p>
<p><b><br />
Gender Bender</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
<img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1949" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cover-ebook-2000px-longest-side-300x281.jpg" alt="female private investigator" width="300" height="281" />As is the case with many professions, media and culture have defined the role of private investigator as one for a man, which often </span><a href="http://swaay.com/women-reshaping-private-investigation-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaves women out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the conversation. However, it could be argued female private investigators have a much better chance of remaining undetected in surveillance. While social code continues to grow and develop, women are often socialized to diminish themselves—to listen, not speak. Follow instead of lead. Men are socialized to be forward and confident in the interest of being some kind of alpha, while women are known to be better at reading a room, picking up on behavioral cues that might inform their investigation, and their perceived gentility improves their chances of a subject or witness trusting and opening up to them. These aspects of our society are the same ones preventing citizens from suspending disbelief when a woman is accused of a violent crime. A woman would never do that. This allows a female private investigator to conduct field surveillance with more freedom. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has spiked over the last 25 years at astronomical proportions, and our population’s socialization has changed dramatically since the invention of social media. While this may have hampered private investigators in their work, the proper tools, flexible strategies, and an analytical mind can get the job done. Whatever a private investigator’s method for remaining inconspicuous in the field, there is no doubt that as society changes, so must their methodology. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1511 size-full" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PHX_MMIWG_NJoe-1024x768.jpg" alt="Indigenous women in this country are more likely than any other group to be raped or murdered. The salt in this gaping wound is they are also least likely to see justice. " width="1024" height="768" />Indigenous women in this country are more likely <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/native-american-women-missing-murder-mmiw-inquiry-canada-us-violence-indigenous-a8487976.html">than any other group</a> to be raped or murdered. The salt in this gaping wound is they are also least likely to see justice. These are very passive terms, but there are no others, because the amount of data available about violent crimes against indigenous women is dwarfed in comparison to those of other groups. Last year, there were 5,646 Native American women entered into the National Crime Information Centre (NCIC) as missing. As of June 2018, there had been 2,758 reported missing. Many of their families have claimed no one bothered to investigate.</p>
<p>The jurisdictional issues surrounding cases occurring on reservations is a giant knot of Christmas lights; difficult to unravel, involving federal, state, and tribal law. It can sometimes be unclear to investigating bodies exactly who should be looking for answers. These cases become stillborn while law enforcement plays jurisdictional musical chairs—trails go cold, witnesses disappear, or develop amnesia, evidence is eroded. These women are not likely to be found, nor are their cases likely to be prosecuted. The disappearance of Ashley Loring HeavyRunner is a chilling example. She went missing from the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana in June of 2017. Her sister begged for help from the Indian Bureau of Affairs, and the FBI did not investigate until March of 2018, nine months later.</p>
<p>Despite the fact tribes on the reservations are guaranteed self-government by the Constitution, the more serious crimes fall under the jurisdiction of the FBI. The FBI is not obligated to notify them if a member of their tribe is reported missing or murdered. On top of that, the crimes do fall under tribal jurisdiction are placed in the hands of a woefully understaffed force. “A lot of times it doesn’t go beyond the missing persons report,” said Marita Growing Thunder, a 19-year-old murdered and missing indigenous women (MMIW) activist.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1512 aligncenter" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/annita_lucchesi_4.jpg" alt="Annita Lucceshi" width="1086" height="724" />In fact, the work being done to preserve information about murdered and missing indigenous women is being performed in large part by private citizens, like <a href="https://fnbc.info/news/cases-missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-continue-fall-through-cracks">Annita Lucceshi</a>, a PhD student at the University of Lethbridge in Southern Alberta. “I realised how difficult it is to get a sense of just how many murdered and missing women there are because it changes constantly and there is so little official information,” Annita told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/native-american-women-missing-murder-mmiw-inquiry-canada-us-violence-indigenous-a8487976.html"><i>Independent</i>.</a> The database she has compiled goes back a little over a century, and she described her experience with obtaining accurate information to be heavy labor. “The police are not helpful. Typically, I get no response at all. If I do, they say they don’t collect the data, or that they won’t be able to pull that information.”</p>
<p>It gets worse. In preparation for his film <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-true-story-behind-wind-river-is-this-hidden-injustice-against-native-american-women-75304"><i>Wind River</i></a>, director Taylor Sheridan paid a handful of lawyers to compile a statistic regarding murdered and missing indigenous women. After three months, they came back empty-handed, but had learned some disturbing facts along the way. As recently as 2013, sexual assault of a Native woman by a non-Native could not be prosecuted because it was a state crime on federal land. Natives accused of crimes against non-Natives can be prosecuted twice, by the federal government and by tribal police. This was rectified when the Violence Against Women Act gave criminal jurisdiction over non-indigenous people who commit sexual violence against Native American women.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1509 aligncenter" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MCI090-L.jpg" alt="Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women " width="429" height="280" />In 2015, the Department of Justice announced they were developing the Tribal Access Program for National Crime Information (TAP) so tribes can enter and view information in the federal NCIC database, thereby streamlining muddled communications between investigating bodies. Ten tribes were selected for the beta-test of this new system, but as of 2016, some had not received their TAP terminals. Once again, the wheels of justice turn at a glacial pace for missing and murdered indigenous women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>If you are a missing person, it helps to be white</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1289" style="width: 785px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1289" class="wp-image-1289" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jasminepic1.png" alt="" width="775" height="433" /><p id="caption-attachment-1289" class="wp-caption-text">(Jasmine Moody vanished in Detroit, Michigan on December 4, 2014.)</p></div></p>
<p>Jasmine Moody, a 22-year old Texas Women’s University student mysteriously vanished on December 4, 2014, while visiting a friend in Detroit, Michigan. Nearly four years later, police are no closer to figuring out what happened to her. News coverage of her disappearance has long since vanished from the scene too.</p>
<p>Approximately 7:30 p.m., the evening of December 4th, Jasmine was last seen leaving her friend’s home in the vicinity of the 3700 block of Baldwin, in the Van Dyke and Mack area of Detroit. Her family, who lives in Texas, is convinced foul play is involved in Jasmine’s disappearance and disappointed in the police department’s response and ensuing investigation.</p>
<p>“My daughter was real popular. She had a lot of friends. She was very social and energetic,” Jasmine’s mother Lisa Kidd told Dateline. “She always had a smile on her face. Always, always.”</p>
<p>Jasmine had known she wanted to be a nurse since she was 16 and described as a well-rounded student at Texas Woman’s University. According to her stepfather Patrick Kidd, Jasmine was a straight-A student, danced, and was training to be part of the U.S. Armed Forces through her school’s ROTC program.</p>
<p>According to police, Jasmine had developed an online relationship with Brittany Gurley, a woman who lived in Detroit. Just a few months after meeting online, Jasmine and Brittany had developed a strong friendship and Jasmine flew to visit Brittany and her family for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>On the evening of December 4th, the two women allegedly got into an argument about Jasmine’s social media posts. Brittany and her family would later tell police that Jasmine put on a hoodie and walked out of the house.</p>
<p>Little else is known about her disappearance. No major ground search was conducted, and ongoing media exposure on a national level has been minimal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1288 alignleft" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/spierer1.png" alt="" width="394" height="535" />In contrast to Jasmine Moody’s case, Lauren Spierer, a 20-year old student at Indiana University, vanished June 3, 2011, after an evening out with friends in Bloomington, Indiana. Lauren, who grew up in Scarsdale, an affluent town in Westchester, New York. Her disappearance quickly garnered national press attention but remains unsolved.</p>
<p>“Lauren’s disappearance has been and continues to be the most heart-wrenching experience of our lives,” Lauren’s family posted on Facebook on June 4, 2018, seven years after her disappearance. “I remember writing a few short months after Lauren’s disappearance that I never thought I would see an October without answers. I could never have imagined we would still be searching for Lauren seven years later. I end this now as I start each morning, hoping today will be the day.”</p>
<p>After an evening out at Kilroy’s Sports Bar with friends, Lauren was last seen on 11th Street and College Avenue in Bloomington at approximately 4:15 a.m. She had left her cell phone and shoes at the bar, presumedly taking her shoes off in the beach-themed bar’s sand-filled courtyard.</p>
<p>National news quickly began covering Lauren’s disappearance while hundreds of volunteers assembled to distribute thousands of fliers and help conduct ground searches of the area. A billboard overlooking the Indiana State Fairgrounds, along Fall Creek Parkway, asks the public for any information that would lead to the whereabouts of Lauren.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_1287" style="width: 596px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1287" class=" wp-image-1287" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/spierer2.png" alt="" width="586" height="439" /><p id="caption-attachment-1287" class="wp-caption-text">(Thousands of flyers of missing person Lauren Spierer have been distributed throughout the country.)</p></div></p>
<p>Hundreds of volunteers continued to turn out daily to help the family in their search.</p>
<p>Lauren’s case was profiled on popular America’s Most Wanted in 2011, leading to dozens of leads but not that one the family needed. Over the years, dozens of news media outlets have covered Lauren’s story.</p>
<p>Early on, Lauren’s parents hired private investigators and today, maintain an active Facebook group.</p>
<p>In one very revealing and heartfelt post, Lauren’s mother writes, “I could not have imagined on June 3, 2011, that my life would ever have any semblance of normalcy. Unfortunately, that word will never be applied to our lives. You learn to live with routines which get you through your days, weeks, months, and years. We will never know normal. Some of the things taken for granted in ordinary families are so far removed from ours it’s difficult to fathom. They range from everyday life events, a wedding, a birth and yes sadly death. What I wouldn’t do to hear Lauren’s voice or even just to notice a text on my phone. Something so simple as a text. My heart breaks at the thought of it. Well, those responsible will never be able to imagine. I have said it before and I know it’s redundant but what could have been an accident in a few short hours became a crime. The worst nightmare any parent or sister could imagine.”</p>
<p>Every day Lauren’s family simply hopes for answers. That’s all any family of a missing person could ask for.</p>
<p>Two young women, one black, one white, both ambitious students couldn’t be treated more differently by the media. One becomes nearly a household name, the other nearly forgotten. With absolute certainty, no one can say exactly why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the numbers?</strong></p>
<p>As of May 31, 2018, there were 87,608 active missing person cases in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Of the active missing person cases listed in NCIC, 40,108 cases are of missing women and 26,842 are black.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1286" style="width: 1221px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1286" class="size-full wp-image-1286" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tablespierer.png" alt="" width="1211" height="799" /><p id="caption-attachment-1286" class="wp-caption-text">(National Crime Information Center Report)</p></div></p>
<p>Names like Chandra Levy, Laci Peterson, Elizabeth Smart, Polly Klaas, Natalee Holloway and Lauren Spierer have become familiar household names. Their missing person cases have dominated the headlines over the years. Cases like Jasmine Moody’s are not rare and unfortunately rarely make the local news.</p>
<p>Historically, whenever a female missing person becomes a national headline, she is almost certain to be a pretty, young white woman.</p>
<p>When was the last time you heard of a missing black female on CNN or other national news outlets?</p>
<p>In an NBC news story “<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5325808/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/damsels-distress/#.W1VGYfZFwdU">Damsels in Distress</a>” Roy Peter Clark, head of Poynter Institute for Media Studies is quoted, “It’s all about sex,” said Clark. “Young white women give editors and television producers what they want.”</p>
<p>“There are several common threads,” said Clark. “The victims that get the most coverage are female rather than male. They are white, in general, rather than young people of color. They are at least middle class, if not upper middle class.”</p>
<p>Some say the cases fit a narrative pattern that storytellers have used for more than a century, a pattern who design still incorporates remnants of an outmoded view of women and black people and their roles in society.</p>
<p>When it comes to popular stories, Clark said, “there is this perverted, racist view of the world. White is good; black is bad. Blonde is good; dark is bad. Young is good; old is bad. And I think we can find versions of this story going back to the tabloid wars of more than a hundred years ago.”</p>
<p>Regardless of class, color or age, it is clear that there is disproportionate coverage of black missing person cases. Referred to as “Missing White Woman Syndrome” and has led to a number of tough on crime measures named after white women who disappeared such as Suzanne’s Law, Kristen’s Law, Jennifer’s Law, Amber Alert and others.</p>
<p>In a study conducted by Baylor University, “<a href="https://www.academia.edu/944503/The_Invisible_Damsel_Differences_in_How_National_Media_Outlets_Framed_the_Coverage_of_Missing_Black_and_White_Women_in_the_Mid-2000s">The Invisible Damsel: Differences in How National Media Outlets Framed the Coverage of Missing Black and White Women in the Mid-2000s</a>,” Professors Moody, Dorris and Blackwell concluded that in addition to race and class, factors such as supposed attractiveness, body size, and youthfulness function as unfair criteria in determining newsworthiness in the national news coverage of missing women. In addition, news coverage of missing black women was more likely to focus on the victim’s problems, such as abusive relationships, a troubled past, while coverage of white women tends to focus on roles as mothers or daughters.</p>
<p>Zach Somers, a sociologist at Northwestern University, noted that while there has been extensive research that shows that white people are more likely than people of color to appear in news coverage as victims of violent crime, there is relatively none when it comes to missing person cases.</p>
<p>Victim blaming appears to be compounding the unequal coverage and reinforces the view that black female victims are not only less innocent, but less worthy of rescue relative to white women. Thus, the term “Damsels in Distress.”</p>
<p>Others have blamed “police brutality” for the lack of publicity given to black female missing persons, attributing the silence to a habit of “sexism and patriarchy” in American society.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1290 aligncenter" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/blackandmissing.png" alt="" width="1137" height="260" /></p>
<p>One group is fighting the imbalance of national media exposure that exists. The <a href="http://blackandmissing.org/">Black and Missing Foundation’s</a> mission is to draw more attention to missing African Americans by providing an outlet for spreading the word through technology and print – and their work is making a difference.</p>
<p>By creating relationships with the media, government agencies, and the public, they are increasing the chances of missing black women being covered in the news and ultimately, to bring them home.</p>
<p>Derica and Natalie Wilson, two sisters-in-law, and founders of the Black and Missing Foundation have been profiled in People Magazine, Essence, Ebony, Huffington Post, Washington Post and developed a partnership with TV One. This year they celebrate ten years, helping thousands of families of missing persons and finding nearly 300 people.</p>
<p>“Many times, we are a family’s last resort – their last hope., says co-founder Natalie Wilson. This platform allows us to open our doors for families searching for their missing loved ones and not restrict access to help.”</p>
<p>Black and Missing Foundation have set the example for other groups to follow, especially the media.</p>
<p>Thomas Lauth of <a href="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/">Lauth Missing Persons: an Expert in Missing Children and Adults</a> noted, &#8220;In the 17 years of conducting missing persons cases for families and non-profit organizations, there is certainly a media and public bias against a missing person of color. When the general public and the media see a blonde 18 year-old on CNN that is missing&#8211;as opposed to an African American female on CNN&#8211;there is immediate attention to the blonde. Luckily there are non profit organizations such as Black and Missing to help bring more exposure to advocacy to the families for persons of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finding missing persons is a cooperative effort between the police, media, social service agencies and especially the public. With every news story, the coverage generates leads and increases the chance of that one lead being reported that will assist law enforcement in the investigation, and even close a case.</p>
<p>When it comes to missing persons there is no black and white, there are only families who are missing their daughters, siblings missing their sisters, children who are missing their mothers. There is no rich or poor, only families, human beings experiencing the most traumatic experience of their lifetimes.</p>
<p>People . . . who need our help.</p>

<p>Every week there are new stories in the news about teenagers who have either run away or been kidnapped. When parents see these tragedies play out through media coverage, there’s usually one common thread running through their minds, “This could not happen to my child.” Despite statistics on the demographics most often affected by missing or runaway teens, no family is immune. <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1882&amp;action=edit">Parents of a missing child or teen will most certainly have never found themselves in these frightful circumstances before and be at a loss for how to proceed.</a> In addition to filing a report with police, the parents might also consider hiring a private investigator to conduct an independent, concurrent investigation. Finding missing teens is not always the speciality of an individual law enforcement agency, which means your child could fall through the cracks. Finding missing teens is not easy, especially when they do not want to be found. That&#8217;s why many families rely on the independent tenacity of private investigators to find their missing teens. <a href="https://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/">Should you hire a private investigator to locate your missing or runaway child?</a></p>
<p><b>An Overwhelming Task </b></p>
<p>The Office of Justice Programs estimates the first 48 hours after your child goes missing are the most crucial in the timeline of any investigation. During these moments, your instinct might be to go find the child yourself or help conduct searches; however, as a parent or guardian of a missing child, your information is the most crucial. A 1982 congressional mandate requires law enforcement to immediately take a report following the disappearance of a child under the age of 18. However, recent reports estimate the excess of some 800,000 missing persons cases reported every year, 85-90% of those cases are individuals under the age of 18. What this statistic tells us is law enforcement, in most parts of the country, are overwhelmed by a caseload (with some departments averaging over 40 cases per investigator) leaving your missing child as a file amidst a stack of equally devastating missing child cases. As law enforcement agencies across the country remain stretched, missing child cases—especially ones where the child appears to have run away—are not always the first priority, as investigators attempt to perform a triage regarding which case requires their attention the most. Private investigators only average between three and four cases at any given time, meaning your child’s case will be at the top of their list of priorities.  During the crucial FIRST 48 hours, having a private investigator treat your case as a priority can be the difference between acquiring invaluable information and losing a lead.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1280 aligncenter" src="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/police.11-2.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="374" /></p>
<p><b>Constitutional Red Tape</b></p>
<p>One of the glowing advantages of hiring a private investigator to find your missing child or teen is the fact PIs possess far more autonomy than the average law enforcement officer or investigator. For instance, when a suspect has been identified, law enforcement often must secure a warrant for them to be tracked as the investigation unfolds. Paperwork and bureaucracy within the chain of command can cause the wheels of justice to turn slowly in regards to local or state law enforcement. Not only are PI’s not required to file this sort of paperwork, but they can also do so without the supervision of a governing law enforcement administration, so the case progression is not stalled for lack of warrant or administration approval.</p>
<p><b>The Binds of Jurisdiction </b></p>
<p>With a private investigator conducting an independent, concurrent investigation, there will never be any issues of jurisdiction when pursuing leads. Say your family lives in Indiana, but while on an out-of-state family vacation, your child goes missing in a crowd. As missing and abducted children across state or even international borders, local law enforcement exponentially lose power to follow leads maybe illuminating the child’s whereabouts.  It is also not uncommon for two or more law enforcement agencies to enter a tug of war when it comes to who has jurisdiction over a particular case based on the specific circumstances. This can lead to the loss of leads or time as agencies hash out the details. Private investigators are never bound by jurisdictional bureaucracy. They can travel between states following the trail of a missing child, all without having to file any paperwork or obtain special permissions from superiors.</p>
<p>While law enforcement may have a wealth of experience and exclusive tools at their disposal, it’s important to remember that these civil servants are often overwhelmed with an immense case-load and can only do so much when it comes to the constitutional and jurisdictional boundaries they cannot cross. Private investigators have the expertise and similar tools of law enforcement, while also having the time to treat your case as a top priority.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p> <span style="font-size: 14px;">For months, the family of 5-year-old Lucas Hernandez wondered if they would ever have answers in his mysterious disappearance. On the day he disappeared, he was left in the care of his father’s girlfriend, Emily Glass. In the missing persons report, Glass told investigators on February 17</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">th</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">, 2018, she saw Lucas playing in his room around three in the afternoon. She then took a shower and fell asleep. When she awoke around six in the evening, Lucas was nowhere to be found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement in Wichita investigated for months, unearthing no credible leads into Lucas’ disappearance. Months later, on May 24</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, locals were shocked after a private investigator blew the case wide open by informing law enforcement Emily Glass had led them to the decomposing remains of little Lucas under a nearby bridge. Why would Glass, after dealing with law enforcement for months, only then break her silence regarding her knowledge of the little boy’s body? The answer is as simple as this: Private investigators have advantages law enforcement do not when it comes to conducting concurrent independent investigations in criminal and missing persons cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how is a private investigator’s approach different from the approach of a local, state, or federal law enforcement agency? The first thing to consider is the caseload of most law enforcement agencies. From the moment an initial report is made, in both criminal and missing persons cases, law enforcement have the meticulous and overwhelming task of gathering evidence to build a case that will secure justice on behalf of the victims and the state. Crime scenes need to be mined for evidence by medical examiners and crime scene technicians. Detectives and other investigators need to canvass witnesses—sometimes dozens of people—in the area who might have seen or heard something. Now imagine the workload of one case multiplied by 40 or 50 times. </span><a href="http://www.evawintl.org/PAGEID31/Best-Practices/FAQs/Caseloads"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An audit conducted in Portland Oregon in 2007</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reviewed law enforcement data from Portland itself, and nine other surrounding cities, to conclude the average caseload for a detective in Portland was a median of 54. This is compared to a 5-year average of 56 cases. Knowing statistics like these are similar in law enforcement agencies all across the country, it’s easy to see how the progress of cases might slow to a crawl. Agencies are overwhelmed, and this is where private investigators have the advantage. Private investigators may only handle one or two cases at a time, giving them their full focus and attention. Wichita law enforcement might have faced similar challenges of an overwhelming caseload when it came to investigating Lucas Hernandez’s disappearance. An article released by the </span><a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article188780399.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wichita Eagle</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in mid-December of 2017 revealed, as of publication, there were still ten homicides from the year 2017 remaining unsolved as the new year approached. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another compelling advantage for private investigators might initially sound like a disadvantage: Private investigators have no powers of arrest. It seems counter-intuitive that a private investigator may use the same tools as law enforcement, ask the same questions, and may even come to the same conclusion as law enforcement without the ability to arrest a suspect for the crime. However, the case of Hernandez showcased exactly why a private investigator—and their inability to arrest—broke the case wide open. Jim Murray of Star Investigations told </span><a href="http://www.kmbc.com/article/lucas-hernandez-story-shows-why-private-investigators-approach-cases-differently/20987001"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KMBC News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Kansas, &#8220;We&#8217;re less of a threat sometimes to people that we&#8217;re talking to because we have no powers of arrest,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We can&#8217;t arrest them.&#8221; This could explain why Emily Glass finally led a private investigator to Lucas’s body, because she knew they could not put handcuffs on her in that moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1795 alignleft" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Los-Angeles-Private-Investigator-300x225.jpg" alt="Los-Angeles-Private-Investigator" width="300" height="225" />Unfortunately, family members and locals will never have the truth about what happened to Lucas. In the wake of the private investigator’s discovery, autopsy reports were found to be inconsistent with what Glass told both police and the PI, but before the People could build a case against her, Glass was found dead from an apparent suicide. However, were it not for the efforts of the private investigator, Lucas’s father may never have had answers in his son’s disappearance.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>By: Kym Pasqualini, Lauth Investigations Feature Crime Writer</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1727" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kidnapping-300x168.jpg" alt="Kidnapping" width="709" height="397" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You receive a phone call and hear the voice of someone you don’t recognize. They tell you they have your child and will kill them unless you pay a ransom. They direct you not to call police or you will never see your child again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would you do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You tell the person on the other end of the phone not to hang up. You don’t want to disconnect with the one person that can reunite you with your child. You plead for your child’s safe return. “Please don’t hurt her. I will do whatever you want,” you cry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They demand you go to the bank and wire a ransom of several thousand dollars. Do you call the police? Do you pay the ransom and hope some thug will return your child to you safe? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A child going missing is every parent’s worst nightmare. For those who do have a missing child, living with such ambiguity is said to be the most traumatic of human experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds like a situation that only happens in the movies, right? Or, something only happening to the wealthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/parents-seattle-warned-about-kidnapping-scams-846163"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsweek</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Seattle Police Department is issuing warnings to parents advising scammers are targeting parents and demanding a ransom in exchange for the safe return of children they kidnapped . . . well, virtually kidnapped. Police throughout the country are following suit.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1728 alignleft" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kidnapped-child-300x169.jpg" alt="kidnapped child" width="382" height="215" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 8, 2017, in Ravensdale, Kings County, approximately 30 miles southeast of Seattle, a mother drops her children off at the school bus. Shortly thereafter, she receives a phone call from a man who threatened to kill her child if she didn’t pay a ransom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother was able to reach out to the school to make sure her children were there. The school confirmed they were safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King’s County Sheriff’s Office told ABC News, this was the first reported incident in their jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another case, a woman called a father “hysterically crying” claiming to be his daughter and stating she had been kidnapped. A man then got on the phone and told the dad if he didn’t pay a ransom, he would hurt his daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers in Denver have responded to several reports of kidnappings. In a press release issued by the Denver Police Department, police say the caller demands a monetary payment in exchange for the release of the victim’s child. The caller dials the parents in the afternoon and demands the ransom to be wired to a bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After investigating the recent incidents in Denver, they determined the kidnappings were false and all children involved in the incidents were found safe.</span></p>
<p><b>Virtually Kidnapped Daughter </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, April 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sean Hollister was at his residence in Longmont, Colorado, about 15 miles northeast of Boulder, and received a frightening call from his 11-year old daughter who he thought was at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My daughter was in tears, sobbing,” Hollister told the Times-Call. “I thought she was in trouble or something. She said, ‘Dad, I’m sorry I let this happen,’ which is exactly what she would say,” Hollister said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I said, ‘What’s wrong,’ and I offered up her name, so he knew my kid’s name,” Hollister said a man got on the phone and told him, “I got your daughter in a truck. She is on her way to Mexico.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hollister told the man he was calling the police, the girl came back on the phone screaming. “Daddy, they are cutting me. Don’t call 911.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollister was able to call police on his cell phone. “The caller told Hollister to get his wallet and identification and promptly leave the house.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1729" style="width: 530px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1729" class=" wp-image-1729" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/stressed-300x160.jpg" alt="Victims of “virtual kidnapping” describe the incident as traumatic." width="520" height="277" /><p id="caption-attachment-1729" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Victims of “virtual kidnapping” describe the incident as traumatic.</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollister’s postman was in the yard when he walked outside. “I’m mouthing ‘Help me,’ and he is freaking out,” said Hollister. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longmont police showed up at his home fast and they took over from there and the caller hung up. Officers quickly determined Hollister’s daughter was safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traumatized father would later find out the callers were trying to pull off a “virtual kidnapping” scam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gap between the cops getting there and finding out my daughter is okay was terrifying,” said Hollister. “Who would think someone would be that cruel?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollister’s caller had a Mexico number, but police say it is possible the caller was local and hijacked the number to appear like the call was made from out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In yet another case, a woman received a frantic call her brother had been kidnapped, injured and bleeding out, demanding thousands of dollars through a wire to return him safely. She was able to reach her brother on another phone and never paid any money, but a clear sign anyone can be a victim of this type of horrific scam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to FBI kidnapping expert, Agent Eric Arbuthnot, several organizations use these scams regularly to make money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thousands of dollars in ransom,” said Arbuthnot. “And you’re talking about a criminal organization that is capable of doing more than one kidnapping at a time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Arbuthnot many of the cases have been happening on the West coast and along the border involving criminal organizations from Mexico, some claiming to be members of the cartel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI has seen recent increases in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monroe Police Department in Connecticut said by using social media, scammers can identify a victim, look up relatives, and reference names of family members and friends to make the call appear legitimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI Supervisory Agent Christopher Johnson said his office in St. Louis, Missouri deals with these types of crimes. “Scammers will often mention specific facts about the parent or victim, likely from information they were able to obtain online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities say about one in five kidnapping cases are successful resulting in the criminal getting their ransom and not getting caught. While extortion has been around for decades, virtual ransom kidnapping calls are increasing around the country.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1730" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1730" class=" wp-image-1730" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Glenn-Milnor-300x167.jpg" alt="FBI Special Agent Glenn Milnor warns parents about virtual kidnapping." width="790" height="440" /><p id="caption-attachment-1730" class="wp-caption-text"><em>FBI Special Agent Glenn Milnor warns parents about virtual kidnapping.</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this emerging scam, the FBI has launched a nationwide campaign to warn parents to fight back against “virtual kidnapping.”</span></p>
<p><b>If you receive a virtual kidnapping ransom call&#8230;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional kidnapping schemes, a “virtual kidnapper” has not actually kidnapped anyone. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, if you receive a call from an individual demanding a ransom for the safe return of a kidnap victim, it is suggested you quickly evaluate the following to determine if you are receiving a legitimate ransom call:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caller insists you stay on the phone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call does not come from your child’s cell phone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caller tries to stop you from contacting the kidnap victim.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call includes demand for ransom to be paid via wire transfer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransom amounts may decrease quickly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Knowing what to do</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police say it is best to hang up the phone; however, if you continue the conversation pay attention to the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you engage the caller, don’t call out your loved one’s name.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliberately try to slow the situation down and ask to speak to your child directly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask “proof of life” questions like, “How do I know my loved one is okay?”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To gain confirmation if your child is an actual kidnapping victim, ask questions only your child would know such as the name of a pet.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen very closely to the voice of the person speaking. If possible record the call.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have someone else try to call your child’s cell phone, school, text, social media, etc., to confirm their safety.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To buy time, repeat the caller’s request and tell them you are writing down the demand or tell the caller you need time to make arrangements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t agree to pay a ransom: by wire or in person.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t deliver money in person.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately call your local FBI office and police.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), as of March 31, 2017, there were 86,618 active missing person cases in the FBI database, with 8,792 entered as involuntary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts agree an actual kidnapping with a ransom demand is quite rare but all experts urge parents to be vigilant.</span></p>
