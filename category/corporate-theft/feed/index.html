<p>Employee theft is a growing problem for businesses across industries. Cases of internal fraud, embezzlement, and theft follow rising economic stresses. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) estimates that fraud costs companies 5% of their annual income; small enterprises are the most vulnerable. Correct preventive measures will help businesses reduce their risks and safeguard their financial situation. This article investigates the reasons behind employee theft, actual incidents, and practical strategies companies may apply to stop and identify internal fraud.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="770" height="664" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.52.18-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-166810" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.52.18-AM.png 770w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.52.18-AM-480x414.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 770px, 100vw" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Why Employee Theft Is Increasing</strong></h2>



<p>Although theft in the workplace has always been a problem, inflation and recession can drive workers into moral lapses. One of the main causes is financial stress, especially in cases when living expenses rise, but salaries stay the same. Some workers excuse their theft from their companies by thinking they are underpaid or undervalued. Others can steal out of entitlement, personal debt, or addiction. Increasing theft possibilities also depends much on the availability of firm resources—cash, inventory, or secret data of all kinds. Without appropriate security systems, companies could unintentionally let dishonest staff members take advantage of weaknesses in control.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strengthening Internal Controls to Prevent Fraud</strong></h2>



<p>Companies without internal controls run more of a chance of theft. Policies that are weak or nonexistent let staff members falsify financial records, siphon cash, or pilfer goods without anybody noticing right away. Reducing employee theft starts with putting robust internal controls into use. These include implementing automated accounting systems tracking odd activity, dual authorization for significant payments, and division of tasks so that no one staff member has total authority over financial operations. Frequent audits should go over inventory, spending reports, and transaction data for disparities. Making sure staff members are aware of these controls helps to discourage theft as well.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implementing Surveillance and Monitoring Systems</strong></h2>



<p>Stopping and identifying employee theft depends critically on surveillance. Putting security cameras in strategic places—like warehouses, cash registers, and stockrooms—helps track suspicious activity. Digital monitoring systems should also be used by businesses to check access records, emails, and corporate equipment for possible fraud. Unauthorized file transfers, odd logins, or too much access to bank records can all be flagged by monitoring software. Implementing surveillance calls for openness; staff members should be informed that security policies are in place, therefore deterring dishonest behavior. Apart from discouraging theft, surveillance systems offer proof should an inquiry be called for.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="770" height="664" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.54.41-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-166811" style="width:520px;height:auto" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.54.41-AM.png 770w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.54.41-AM-480x414.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 770px, 100vw" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Encouraging Whistleblowing and Anonymous Reporting</strong></h2>



<p>Employee tips are among the best tools available to find internal theft. Many workers know of dishonest behavior occurring in their company, but they worry about reprisals should they disclose misbehavior. Establishing a safe workplace for reporters will help greatly minimize theft. Companies should set up anonymous hotlines or encrypted email channels where staff members may document questionable behavior free from concern about consequences. Providing cash incentives for confirmed fraud reports helps staff members to come forward as well. Studies of organizations with whistleblower policies have found that they recoup financial losses faster and spot fraud more immediately.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Real-Life Case: Employee Theft in 2024</strong></h2>



<p>A well-known incident of employee theft in 2024 concerned a Florida mid-sized company&#8217;s finance manager who manipulated payroll records to embezzlement of over $1.2 million. The manager established fictitious staff members and directed pay into personal accounts. Because payroll approvals lacked supervision, the theft stayed unreported for more than two years. Discrepancies in pay distribution were discovered during an external audit at last, which set off an investigation. The case emphasizes the need to routinely review finances, outside audits, and background checks for staff members in critical roles.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conducting Regular and Unannounced Audits</strong></h2>



<p>One useful weapon in spotting theft is unannounced audits. Random financial reviews let staff members know they are under observation, therefore lowering the possibility of dishonest activity. These audits ought to address financial activities, inventory levels, petty cash handling, and expense reporting. To conduct objective reviews, one can engage an outside forensic accounting company to carry out independent audits. Surprise cash counts also help to find skimming or illegal withdrawals. Apart from revealing theft, regular audits help to emphasize the need for responsibility inside a company.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lauth’s Investigative Methods for Detecting Employee Theft</strong></h2>



<p>Lauth Investigations focuses on revealing employee embezzlement and internal fraud. Among their approaches include surveillance, undercover investigations, and forensic accounting. Examining financial records and tracking staff behavior helps investigators identify fraudulent activity and compile proof. Under circumstances when companies believe there is long-term theft, covert monitoring helps to monitor dubious staff members and their actions. Before recruiting staff, background searches and integrity tests also enable companies to spot any hazards. Lauth&#8217;s knowledge of white-collar crime investigations gives businesses the tools they need to properly spot and stop theft.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creating a Strong, Ethical Workplace Culture</strong></h2>



<p>A strong corporate culture opposes immoral behavior. Employees who feel appreciated and believe in the objective of the business are less prone to steal. Businesses could encourage ethics by means of reinforcement of corporate principles, communication, and leadership. Frequent training courses on ethical decision-making and fraud prevention help to keep the issue fresh in staff members&#8217; consciousness. By means of employee recognition programs, rewarding honesty and integrity helps to lower the temptation to steal as well. Employees are less prone to participate in dishonest behavior when they feel that misbehavior will not be accepted.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="773" height="512" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.57.01-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-166812" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.57.01-AM.png 773w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-9.57.01-AM-480x318.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 773px, 100vw" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Legal Consequences and Employee Accountability</strong></h2>



<p>Employees must be made aware of the consequences of theft. Clear regulations defining disciplinary actions for dishonesty guarantees staff members that theft will result in termination and maybe legal action. Zero-tolerance rules should be followed by companies to guarantee fair investigations grounded on facts. Pursuing legal action against the guilty party not only helps to recoup money losses but also discourages others from trying like-crimes upon detection of theft. Publicly handling instances of corporate fraud helps to underline the fact that theft will not be overlooked.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Employee theft is a rising issue especially in uncertain economic times. Businesses run enormous financial losses without appropriate controls. Important ways to stop fraud are strengthening internal controls, running frequent audits, using surveillance, and pushing whistleblowing. Actual events such as the payroll fraud episode in 2024 highlight the need for early surveillance. Investigative companies like Lauth Investigations give companies the knowledge required to find and address internal theft. Strict responsibility policies and an ethical workplace culture help companies guard against financial damage and guarantee long-term success.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today&#8217;s world, companies face many risks. One of the biggest risks comes from within the company itself. These are called insider threats, and&nbsp; when employees or other trusted people inside a company do things that harm the business. These actions can be stealing secrets, damaging property, or even leaking important information. This blog will explain how companies can use corporate investigations to protect themselves from insider threats.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-insider-threats"><strong>What Are Insider Threats?</strong></h2>



<p>Insider threats are actions taken by people inside a company that can harm the business. These people can be employees, contractors, or even business partners. Sometimes, they do these harmful things on purpose. Other times, they do it by accident, but the results can be just as damaging.</p>



<p>For example, a worker might accidentally share a company’s secret information with the wrong person. In another case, an employee might purposely steal customer data to sell it to someone else. Both of these are insider threats, even though one was an accident and the other was on purpose.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-insider-threats-dangerous"><strong>Why Are Insider Threats Dangerous?</strong></h2>



<p>Insider threats are dangerous because the people inside a company already have access to important information. They know the company’s secrets, systems, and weaknesses. Because of this, they can cause more harm than someone from the outside.</p>



<p>Imagine if a worker who knows all the passwords to the company’s computer system decided to share them with someone else. This could allow a hacker to get into the company’s system and steal important data. Because the worker had inside access, the hacker&#8217;s job becomes much easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-types-of-insider-threats"><strong>Common Types of Insider Threats</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdz7qtZDbQjoHvdJnDzpXcIKWBYWWgQ5sPPR05cl2wd2bz_vgxfSesLGmZIXKlA-vQBcu5YEopQP1lC1UAXuHgtaBPtd8uELUqG1QsxtsAI8Ac6fO-ovFEOmJzYqXd9PrFoUjVK8DBXElwzzaBxkOMt6kNTmtEr4yI46uL_DrXcW0MoG27TSw?key=gW9ZBATFPoJlwf51PL2wSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>There are different types of insider threats, and it&#8217;s important to understand each one so companies can protect themselves.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Malicious Insiders</strong>: These are people who intentionally want to harm the company. They might be upset with their job, want revenge, or want to make money by selling company secrets. These insiders are very dangerous because they know the company well and can plan their attacks carefully.</li>



<li><strong>Careless Insiders</strong>: Sometimes, insiders do not mean to cause harm, but they do so by being careless. For example, an employee might accidentally click on a phishing email that gives hackers access to the company&#8217;s data. Even though the employee did not mean to do harm, the results can be just as bad as if they did.</li>



<li><strong>Third-Party Insiders</strong>: These are people who work with the company but are not direct employees. For example, a contractor might have access to the company’s systems and accidentally leak important information. Because they are not full-time employees, they might not follow the same security rules, making them a potential threat.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-corporate-investigations-help"><strong>How Corporate Investigations Help?</strong></h2>



<p>Corporate investigations are a way for companies to protect themselves from insider threats. These investigations involve looking closely at what is happening inside the company to find any problems or risks.</p>



<p>Investigators might look at things like emails, computer files, and even security camera footage. They do this to find out if anyone is doing something that could harm the company. If they find a problem, they can work to fix it before it gets worse.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steps-in-a-corporate-investigation"><strong>Steps in a Corporate Investigation</strong></h2>



<p>There are several steps involved in a corporate investigation. These steps help ensure that the investigation is thorough and finds any potential insider threats.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Identifying the Problem</strong>: The first step is to figure out what the problem is. This could be a missing file, strange behavior from an employee, or a security breach. Identifying the problem early is important because it allows the investigation to focus on the right areas.</li>



<li><strong>Gathering Evidence</strong>: After identifying the problem, the next step is to gather evidence. This could include looking at emails, checking computer logs, and interviewing employees. The goal is to find proof of what is happening so that the company can take action.</li>



<li><strong>Analyzing the Evidence</strong>: Once the evidence is gathered, it needs to be analyzed. This means looking closely at the data to find patterns or signs of wrongdoing. For example, if an employee is sending a lot of emails to a competitor, this could be a sign that they are leaking information.</li>



<li><strong>Taking Action</strong>: After the evidence has been analyzed, the company can take action. This might mean firing an employee, changing security protocols, or even involving law enforcement if the situation is serious. The goal is to stop the insider threat before it can cause more harm.</li>



<li><strong>Preventing Future Threats</strong>: The final step is to put measures in place to prevent future insider threats. This could include better training for employees, stronger security systems, or regular checks to ensure everything is running smoothly.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-role-of-technology-in-corporate-investigations"><strong>The Role of Technology in Corporate Investigations</strong></h2>



<p>Technology plays a big role in corporate investigations. With the help of advanced tools, companies can monitor their systems more closely and detect insider threats more quickly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfnDlAXjyYGt80JhqBLMSOODlFsOpk26iLyOhWedmx0Fc0pQ0i3GA-bEgYHyz6I1Drj2DdDGD3c-lozqX1TSmiWgZ5OKaIompra7WB--2QZXZrLuu0Fs0BmiK956TRwyUi3BjqfZ15L4ZXQUpLMLbAqQQhqwF4EKPngC-Dnp7dtWnr_kSl3Rw?key=gW9ZBATFPoJlwf51PL2wSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>For example, many companies use software that can track employee activity on company computers. This software can alert the company if an employee is doing something suspicious, like trying to access files they shouldn’t. This early warning system can help prevent insider threats before they cause any damage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-case-studies-real-life-examples-of-insider-threats"><strong>Case Studies: Real-Life Examples of Insider Threats</strong></h2>



<p>To understand how serious insider threats can be, let&#8217;s look at some real-life examples.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The Edward Snowden Case</strong>: Edward Snowden was a contractor for the U.S. government who leaked classified information. He had access to important files and used that access to share secrets with the public. This case shows how dangerous insider threats can be when someone with inside knowledge decides to act against the organization.</li>



<li><strong>The Coca-Cola Recipe Theft Attempt</strong>: In 2006, an employee at Coca-Cola tried to steal the secret recipe for Coca-Cola and sell it to Pepsi. Pepsi reported the attempt to Coca-Cola, and the employee was caught. This case highlights how insider threats can be driven by greed and how they can be stopped with the right measures in place.</li>



<li><strong>Target Data Breach</strong>: In 2013, hackers stole credit card information from millions of Target customers. The hackers gained access to Target’s systems through a third-party contractor. This case shows how third-party insiders can pose a threat, even if they do not work directly for the company.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-best-practices-for-preventing-insider-threats"><strong>Best Practices for Preventing Insider Threats</strong></h2>



<p>Preventing insider threats requires a proactive approach. Here are some best practices that companies can follow to protect themselves:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Conduct Regular Employee Training</strong>: Employees should be trained on how to recognize and avoid insider threats. This includes being aware of phishing emails, securing their workstations, and following company security policies.</li>



<li><strong>Implement Strong Access Controls</strong>: Not everyone in the company needs access to all information. By limiting access to only those who need it, companies can reduce the risk of insider threats.</li>



<li><strong>Monitor Employee Activity</strong>: Regularly monitoring employee activity can help catch suspicious behavior early. This could include checking email usage, reviewing access logs, and keeping an eye on file transfers.</li>



<li><strong>Use Technology Wisely</strong>: Implementing the right technology can help companies detect and prevent insider threats. This could include security software, encryption tools, and regular system audits.</li>



<li><strong>Foster a Positive Work Environment</strong>: A happy and engaged workforce is less likely to become a source of insider threats. Companies should work to create a positive work environment where employees feel valued and heard.</li>
</ol>



<p>Insider threats are a serious risk for any company. Because these threats come from within, they can be more difficult to detect and prevent. However, with the right strategies, including corporate investigations, companies can protect themselves. By being proactive, using technology, and following best practices, businesses can reduce the risk of insider threats and keep their operations safe.If you suspect an insider threat or need help with a corporate investigation, contact <a href="hirelauth@lauthinvestigations.com">Lauth Investigations International today</a>.</p>

<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/employee-theft-statistics/">Research suggests</a> that 75% of employees have stolen from their place of work in the past, making corporate theft a priority issue for any business owner or CEO with self-preservation high on their agenda.</p>



<p>Every employer likes to imagine that they&#8217;ve hired a trustworthy team rather than created a den of thieves. However, unfortunately, as many as 95% of U.S. companies get caught out at least once by an enemy lurking within.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, workplace theft runs up an annual bill of $50 billion annually for American businesses. Fortunately, a strategic corporate theft investigation can stop employee theft in its tracks and make it less likely to happen in the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing Employee Theft by Strengthening Corporate Culture</strong></h3>



<p>When we think about theft prevention, it is easy to focus solely on locking down assets and ramping up security protocols, but there is another area of concern that shouldn&#8217;t be overlooked. Research shows that unhappy employees are more likely to behave unethically towards their employer. Employees that feel valued and grateful are <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/04/when-employees-feel-grateful-theyre-less-likely-to-be-dishonest">less likely to be dishonest</a>.</p>



<p>This provides yet another reason to add to your list of why corporate culture is worth investing in. A great place to start when it comes to building a stronger workplace culture is with a <a href="https://lauthinvestigations.com/corporate-culture-audit/">corporate culture audit</a>, providing clear oversight of the current status quo and a clear path to improve and enhance culture for the better.</p>



<p>Of course, not all would-be thieves will be deterred by a place within a happy workplace. This makes comprehensive <a href="https://lauthinvestigations.com/background-checks/">corporate background checks</a> an essential addition to the employer&#8217;s toolkit. It also makes vigilance among leadership essential, and swift action a smart move when the need to launch a corporate theft investigation arises.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Launching Effective Corporate Theft Investigations</strong></h3>



<p>Workplace theft can vary dramatically in scope and scale, ranging from minor losses of things like stationery from a few slippery-fingered team members through to widespread and coordinated theft of expensive equipment, retail stock, sensitive data, financial assets, and more. While the proportion of the issue will certainly shape the urgency of the response, all employee theft should be taken seriously before it contributes to a negative shift in corporate culture.</p>



<p>A corporate theft investigation should focus on the achievement of four main objectives. The first is to identify the perpetrators, the second is to secure evidence of their activities. The third is to recover lost assets where possible, and the fourth is to respond appropriately, ranging from disciplinary action through to prosecution of those involved.<br>If you are concerned about employee theft in your place of business and are unsure how to proceed, our dedicated team of corporate investigators here at Lauth Investigations is ready to assist. We will guide you through every step of the investigatory process, from conducting undercover operations to interviewing witnesses and compiling evidence for legal proceedings.

<p>It&#8217;s every company&#8217;s worst nightmare. The very individual trusted to balance the books and safeguard assets has decided to try their hand at embezzlement. If your accountant or another trusted individual with financial oversight has done your enterprise dirty, what can you do? Rather than panic, it&#8217;s time to roll out a four-part plan to seek justice and get back on your feet.</p>



<p>Embezzlement is one of the nastiest kinds of white collar crime because its very nature implies a vicious abuse of trust. When someone intentionally misappropriates the assets that were entrusted to them, the sense of betrayal can be just as brutal as the hole in your balance sheets—which may be modest or may run into millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shockingly, white collar crime costs American businesses <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/white-collar-crime-statistics/">billions if not trillions</a> of dollars each year. Starkly, this means that, yes, it really can happen to you. More optimistically, it means that victims are not alone, and corporate experts such as those here at Lauth Investigations International are seasoned in providing the critical support you need to weather the storm ahead.</p>



<p><strong>Detecting Embezzlement Doesn&#8217;t Have to Be the Start of a Nightmare</strong></p>



<p>When an accountant or bookkeeper engages in white collar crime, detecting their actions can be difficult—after all, <em>they</em> are the experts in making the numbers add up. However, this fact alone demonstrates why additional oversight, background checks, and security protocols are so vital in white collar crime prevention.</p>



<p>Once you discover that gaping hole in your company&#8217;s finances, there isn&#8217;t a moment to lose. Any delay at this juncture can provide opportunity for the thief in your coop to take their final spoils and deftly cover their tracks—so don&#8217;t provide them with the satisfaction. Instead, contact an expert corporate investigations company so that they can immediately jump on evidence gathering and guide you through self-protective next steps.</p>



<p><strong>Step 1: Rapid Corporate Investigations</strong></p>



<p>Before you begin the process of recovering the health of your business, it is critical not only to understand the scale and nature of the crime but also to gather the concrete proof that will be required to out-maneuverer its perpetrator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the realm of workplace investigations, this calls for a specific skillset. The corporate investigator may need to deep-dive into forensic accounting, look at CCTV footage, interview employees, conduct background investigations on suspects, and much more. Urgency is key for ensuring that the trail doesn&#8217;t go cold.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: Pursuing Asset Recovery</strong></p>



<p>Depending on the nature of the crime and of your enterprise, asset recovery may be a timely process that runs through the courts or it may take place behind closed doors. Either way, the caliber of your evidence and the integrity of the investigations that generated it will be your ultimate assets. For example, our seasoned corporate investigations team is ever-ready to build and document an air-tight case, advise on legal obligations, and even provide expert testimony should the need arise.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: Planning For Financial Shortfalls</strong></p>



<p>It can be brutally unfair, but following white collar crime, asset recovery can take time and is often only partial. This makes planning to plug any financial shortfalls key. This might make cash crisis management, restructuring, or debt restructuring strategically important as you keep your organization&#8217;s head above water.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: Safeguarding Against Future White Collar Crime</strong></p>



<p>No matter the scale of losses following a white collar crime, no business will want to repeat the experience. Now that you know who to turn to for effective corporate investigations support, you have gained more than the capability to react to a rogue accountant. If you partner with Lauth Investigations International, you also have an essential toolkit for criminality prevention.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pexels-sora-shimazaki-5668837-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-135218" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pexels-sora-shimazaki-5668837-980x735.jpg 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pexels-sora-shimazaki-5668837-480x360.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure></div>



<p>No matter how much money you throw at the latest security hardware, CCTV software, or highly-trained security guards, your company may still experience employee theft. For the vast majority of businesses, sadly, the greatest threats when it comes to losing assets are individuals working under the very same roof. So much so that <a href="https://community.mis.temple.edu/tkaye/files/2017/08/RMI-2901-Part-2-submission.pdf">90% of thefts from workplaces</a> come at the hands of the employees themselves. This makes preventing corporate theft a priority, so how can a corporate private investigator assist?</p>



<p>To prevent corporate theft effectively, it helps to keep in mind that it comes in many forms. A bad actor or two among your seemingly dedicated team may make off with money or inventory, certainly. But the thing they steal could just as equally be sensitive customer data, intellectual property, or even time itself. Whichever risk looms largest at your place of business, a corporate private investigator can assist with both prevention and damage mitigation. Read on to discover how.</p>



<p><strong>Proactively Preventing Corporate Theft</strong></p>



<p>The price tags that come with various tactics to prevent corporate theft may seem prohibitive but studies suggest that they are well worth the investment. To look at the example of employee fraud, researchers found that <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/employee-theft-statistics/">companies that invest in fraud prevention</a> tend to spend 42% less on fraud responses such as litigation, fines, and penalties. A private corporate investigator is an ideal ally to minimize the possibility of future thefts.</p>



<p>Preventing those bad actors from entering your place of employment in the first place is inevitably rewarding when it comes to reducing employee theft risk. A private corporate investigator is uniquely poised to perform comprehensive background checks because their licensure grants them access to many of the same databases used by law enforcement.</p>



<p>Another excellent strategy for preventing corporate theft is ensuring that corporate culture is strong and thriving. Unhappy employees soon become disgruntled ones who may justify to themselves decisions such as bolstering their pay through embezzlement or simply turning a blind eye to a colleague engaged in inventory theft. To get a clear sense of your current corporate culture standing, speak to a Lauth private corporate investigator about the investigatory and remedial elements within a <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-culture-audit/">Corporate Culture Audit</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Damage Control From a Corporate Private Investigator</strong></p>



<p>When a theft has already occurred—or even a pattern of employee theft emerged—a corporate private investigator will make quick work of illuminating the facts and nipping ongoing thievery in the bud. They alone can conduct an expert investigation that is entirely free from the legal risk of bias that comes with colleagues investigating each other.</p>



<p>Not only can showcasing zero-tolerance by enacting a swift <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-theft/">assisted corporate theft investigation</a> address the issue at hand, but it can also help to shift culture and safety in the workplace for the better. Nearly 60% of companies that <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/employee-theft-statistics/">conduct a diligent investigation</a> end up in a better place in the long run, and those that combine all of the tactics above will be able to enjoy not only reduced threat risk and a more secure working environment but also an associated boost to productivity, team cohesion, and bottom line.<br>Are you ready to learn more about how a corporate private investigator can assist in preventing corporate theft? <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/contact-lauth-investigations/">Reach out to the specialist team</a> here at Lauth Investigations International for a no-obligation consultation on the tailored solutions that we can place at your disposal.</p>

<p>When it comes to workplace theft, few forms of criminality represent such a hefty potential drain on company resources than a steady flow of inventory disappearing from your warehouse. It might start out with a few small losses here and there, raising mild alarm but getting swept aside as running the business is prioritized. However, this kind of industrial theft can escalate quickly—especially when the perpetrators think getting away with the loot is an easy mark. <a href="https://securastock.com/workplace-theft-is-eating-your-revenue/">Employees steal $50 billion</a> from U.S. businesses every year, and if your numbers aren&#8217;t adding up, then you&#8217;ve just become part of that statistic.</p>



<p>For the HR team or CFO of any enterprise blighted by warehouse losses, it can soon seem as if the problem is out of hand with no solution in sight. Catching thieves red handed can be challenging for those whose role is already demanding enough. In these instances, an industrial theft investigator offers a port in the storm. But how exactly does this specialist private investigator tackle occurrences of industrial theft? Today, let&#8217;s look at red flags associated with this problem and how a PI can help restore honesty to your back end team.</p>



<p><strong>Raising the Alarm on Warehouse Theft</strong></p>



<p>Long before you decide to put that industrial theft investigator on speed dial, you likely went through the experience of beginning to smell a rat, before becoming confident that something untoward was afoot. Perhaps you&#8217;re still in the middle of that transition—and if so, what are the red flags that you might look out for?</p>



<p>Of course, the most textbook issue arising is an awareness that your stock level inventories don&#8217;t match your sales records. But, there are more nuanced signals, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might spot that sales seem to drop off on days when certain members of your team are on duty or that invoices are missing. Maybe you keep finding stock sitting near loading bays or outside exits, while rumors begin to swirl or morale takes a tumble. You might notice that certain team members are reluctant to take their accrued leave, while showcasing increasing purchasing power or nipping off for clandestine meetings during working hours. All of these indicators should raise the hairs on the back of your neck, but without proof, what can you do?</p>



<p><strong>How an Industrial Theft Investigator Closes the Door On Warehouse Theft</strong></p>



<p>So, the warning signs are there and you know you have to act quickly. It&#8217;s time to bring in a professional to nip this issue in the bud, and it&#8217;s a specialist industrial theft investigator that you need. There are a number of ways that this type of PI can help you—and sometimes, the mere presence of an industrial theft investigator may lead perpetrators to stop dead in their tracks. But, the goal here is to ensure that this doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p>



<p>An industrial theft investigator will combine a number of strategies. They will begin a careful investigation of the thefts that have already occurred to illuminate the facts. This may include tactics such as surveillance, interviews, investigating individuals, and conducting digital forensics. Simultaneously, they will be able to introduce background checks and employee screening to ensure you don&#8217;t have any more nefarious actors entering your workforce. Finally, they will be able to conduct a thorough physical and procedural risk assessment of your warehouse, providing you with the opportunity to make key updates to your infrastructure, company policy, security protocols, and more.<br>Are disappearances from your warehouse taking chunks out of your bottom line? An industrial theft investigator can put a stop to stock hemorrhaging today—so why not <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/contact-lauth-investigations/">reach out for a no-obligation consultation</a> and discuss the support you need. The industrial theft investigations team at Lauth Investigations International is always only a phone call or a message away.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-thisisengineering-3862365-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-134296" width="405" height="607"/></figure></div>



<p>If you think that white collar crime is something only committed by manicured suit-wearing types in office buildings, it&#8217;s time to think again. If you work in construction and you&#8217;re shaking your head in disbelief, then consider this your wakeup call. Construction embezzlement happens every day in America, and safeguarding your business against the sly intentions of fraudsters and scam artists could save it from a derailing crisis.</p>



<p>Joy Wilde was the trusted bookkeeper of a Californian construction company. Her boss, Greg Weimann, had no idea that Wilde had been fraudulently siphoning funds out of his business for years. By the time he realized what was going on, she&#8217;s embezzled the staggering sum of $877,000 from the company. Last year, Wilde <a href="https://www.globalconstructionreview.com/construction-bookkeeper-sentenced-10-years-embezzl/">was sentenced</a> to 10 years in jail for her crimes. A satisfying justice, perhaps, but you can bet that recovering from such a devastating loss and the upheaval of a law suit, media coverage, may take the victim just as long.</p>



<p>The tough truth of this tale is that Joy Wilde serves as only one example of endemic corporate fraud—criminality that carries a global annual price tag expected to rise to <a href="https://www.riskmanagementmonitor.com/construction-fraud-costs-an-estimated-860-billion/">$1.5 trillion by 2025</a>. So, if white collar crime has nothing to do with the kind of collar on a neck that sits behind a desk, what exactly does the term mean? Simply put, white collar crime describes the actions of anyone in business who illegally takes money from their employer or anyone else they do business with. That means customers, clients, suppliers, or subcontractors can be the target, and crucially, so can you.</p>



<p><strong>Safeguard Your Company Against Construction Embezzlement</strong></p>



<p>Denoting an equally unfriendly term, embezzlement is when someone steals or misappropriates of funds placed in their trust or belonging to their employer. If you run a construction company, then you won&#8217;t have any difficulty envisioning the ample opportunity for embezzlement that this industry affords. Payment applications and invoices can be falsified, labor and material costs inflated, change orders manipulated, and the Schedule of Values used to conceal substituted savings and divert funds. When the dangers of bid fixing and collusion are added to this equation, construction companies find themselves in murky waters indeed.</p>



<p>This raises the obvious question: how can such companies protect themselves against the possible impacts of construction embezzlement and other forms of white collar crime? Well, safeguarding can be conducted in a number of different ways. Enlisting a corporate investigations firm to carry out <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/background-checks/">comprehensive background checks</a> and <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-culture-audit/">periodic corporate culture audits</a> can help you identify foxes in the hen house before they strike, so to speak. It is our experience that there are usually red flags to be found long before an employee makes off with the spoils.<br>For companies who find themselves having already fallen foul of an embezzler, <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-investigations/">gathering evidence and acting quickly</a> is the best way to kick-start damage control.

<p>When evidence points to the unpleasant reality that someone has targeted your organization, it&#8217;s not the time to bury your head in the sand. From a cybersecurity threat to white collar crime; from fraud or extortion to a physical break-in: it&#8217;s safe to assume that the violation in question isn&#8217;t an isolated incident. You&#8217;re going to need to take immediate steps to plug leaks, remove vulnerabilities, beef up securities, and assess the damage that has been done. Crucially, it&#8217;s time to call a corporate theft investigator, and there isn&#8217;t a minute to lose. Corporate theft investigations are the first step in getting to the bottom of the problem. </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>The Many Faces Of Corporate Theft</strong></li></ol>



<p>Corporate theft comes in many guises, and business leaders should be mindful of all of them. The assets that bad actors might target include physical inventory, financial assets, intellectual property, and more. The actors themselves could be members of your team on any level—making the issue one of internal corporate theft—or supposedly trustworthy business partners, suppliers, or clients who have been granted just enough access to do harm. Finally, it might be an outsider with the wherewithal to bypass your security entirely—denoting external corporate theft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Complicating matters, those doing the stealing will likely bend over backwards to cover their tracks—so when a workplace investigation is called for, you&#8217;ll want to be prepared that it might uncover a rot that has festered. The good news is that a seasoned corporate investigator will not only be able to reveal the extent of nefarious actions, but advise on the steps to take next in the name of damage control and recovery. Whether they collaborate with your HR investigator or take full control of theft-related HR investigations, you can be confident that any threat will be effectively neutralised, allowing you to pursue justice and ultimately get back to what you do best.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"><li><strong>Hiring a Corporate Investigator</strong></li></ol>



<p>Discovering that your business has fallen prey to corporate theft can leave many executives in a tailspin. Thoughts of reputational damage, rifts with shareholders, or potential legal ramifications are certainly daunting. However, this is where the tactic of hiring a corporate investigation firm for expert assistance comes into its own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dedicated workplace investigator is an expert at discreetly navigating exceptionally sensitive issues of this nature, and will act swiftly to resolve the challenge at hand while maintaining utmost confidence. The corporate investigation process can take place with minimal disruption to your team and daily operations, with information shared on a strictly need-to-know basis and conclusions kept under wraps until you have a concrete plan of action in place. Of course, the corporate investigator is also well versed at collaborating with law enforcement and will ensure that your company&#8217;s actions are compliant, ethical, and legally air-tight as workplace investigations progress.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"><li><strong>How To Prevent Corporate Theft</strong></li></ol>



<p>Undoubtedly, any business owner would rather never face the need for corporate theft investigations. So how can corporate investigation services help you lessen the risk in the first place? Well, diligent <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/background-checks/">background checks</a> on recruits and business partners is a great place to start.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="948" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/noncompete_55849953-1024x948.png" alt="" class="wp-image-133925" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/noncompete_55849953-980x908.png 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/noncompete_55849953-480x445.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p>Corporate entities and organizations the world over go to great lengths to protect their intellectual property and self-built foundations of knowledge. In this vein, contracts that protect against non-compete violations allow employers to invest in developing the skill set of their employees without fear that they will turn around and take a pay-off from a competitor, or even set up shop offering the exact same service up the street.</p>



<p>The repercussions when a non-compete contract is breached can be costly and complex to navigate. This means that taking every step to mitigate violations is prudent planning. With that in mind, read on to discover Lauth Investigation&#8217;s top tips for minimizing the risk of non-compete violations—and what to do if you suspect something underhand is already afoot.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Keeping Non-Compete Contracts up to Date</strong></h3>



<p>Laws change, roles change, and the needs of any given business will inevitably change too. Ensuring that non-competes remain practical and legally applicable can help you avoid future vulnerability. Because of the unique nature of each organization&#8217;s operation and each employees role, non-competes must be tailor made.</p>



<p>Factors such as locational jurisdictions, business or asset acquisitions, and what is considered an industry-specific reasonable duration of contract must all be taken into account. In contrast, a cookie-cutter approach to non-compete contracts can be risky, as any strategic holes may disincline the courts from upholding the contract in question. Also keep in mind that—when updating non-competes for current employees—it is vital to ensure a consideration is provided in return for their renewed agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ensuring Security Is Locked Down</strong></h3>



<p>Even with the most air-tight non-compete agreements in place, the risk always remains that an employee will decide that breaching their contract is worth the consequences. Temptation to accept a bribe in return for providing access to computer systems, documents, or designs is always a possibility. One of the ways in which companies can reduce this risk is by making security a top priority. Having <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-investigations/">electronic and on-site security provisions regularly reviewed</a>—and making employees aware of both measures in place and their own responsibility—can be a reminder that they risk getting caught in the act when temptation strikes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Staying on Top of Corporate Culture</strong></h3>



<p>A thriving corporate culture not only means satisfied employees and larger profits, but also enhanced company loyalty. In contrast, when toxic corporate culture is allowed to fester, organizations run the risk of their employees feeling far more inclined to turn on the hand that feeds them. Diligently monitoring the health of workplace culture offers multi-faceted protection. If tackling corporate culture for the first time, a <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-culture-audit/">Corporate Culture Audit</a> can be a great place to start.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Being Proactive When Employment Ends</strong></h3>



<p>When an employee quits or is terminated, an exit interview provides the perfect opportunity for a non-compete refresher. Reminding of ongoing legal obligations can ensure that former employees are clear on the legal repercussions if they choose to breach their contract. It also provides an opportunity for them to disclose their intention to work for a competitive company—the omission of which may impact their credibility if a non-compete violation occurs in the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reaching Out to a Competitive Employer</strong></h3>



<p>When a former employee does go to work for a competitor, the prior employer may request their consent to inform the new employer of the standing non-compete contract. Equally, if suspicion is growing, the prior employer may decide to reach out independently to ensure that the competitive business is aware that legal obligations are in play. In such instances, swift action can minimize damage.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Safeguarding Client Relationships</strong></h3>



<p>When valuable clients are involved and concerns exist that a former employee may not have positive intentions, proactive protection of customer relationships can be vital. Informing customers that the former employee in question is no longer working for the company and immediately connecting them with new representatives can reduce the risk of client theft and non-compete violations. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When You Suspect a Non-Compete Violation</strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to non-compete violations, time is usually of the essence. Swift action can effectively minimize both financial and reputational losses, while reducing the potential complexity of litigation. When suspicion arises, <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/non-compete-violations/">a skilled private investigator</a> can be an ultimate ally—launching diligent corporate investigations, carrying out surveillance, and information gathering—as they build a case that will allow you to take immediate action. If a possible non-compete violation is on your radar or you require help in assessing your current level of risk, <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/contact-lauth-investigations/">contact Lauth Investigations</a> for immediate assistance.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anete-lusina-5240547-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-133848" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anete-lusina-5240547-980x654.jpg 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pexels-anete-lusina-5240547-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p>A private investigator can identify employee fraud and thief in your workforce, eliminating future threats while maintaining objectivity.</p>



<p>Despite the ability of a business to flourish in any economy, every company is still vulnerable to the possibility of employee theft or fraud. Like a frog in a boiling pot, sometimes companies can be taken by surprise when the theft has gradually grown over a period of time, and no one is the wiser until the business takes an unexpected financial hit. Companies can protect themselves from these frauds with costly in-house investigations into the crime, but a private investigator can go a long way towards identifying all perpetrators, no matter how high up the chain of command it goes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.statisticbrain.com/employee-theft-statistics/">Recent statistics</a> from several government agencies who supervise finances and labor estimate theft committed annually by employees reaches an excess of $50 billion. Even an isolated incident can blanket a company in a crisis and leave them clawing out of the depths of bankruptcy. It starts with small things, such as taking office supplies for personal use. When this action goes unchecked, the employee might begin taking from petty cash without authorization. The level of the theft will always ratchet up the longer the thief goes undetected.</p>



<p>When an investigator attempts to identify employee fraud is knowing <a href="https://www.trustify.info/for-business/insight/how-to-investigate-employee-theft">what to look for</a>. Elliot Rysenbry of Trustify says there are six warning signs of employee theft for which Human Resources should be vigilant.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Workaholics</strong><ul><li>Behaviors of people who might be very dedicated to their jobs are also characteristic of people who might be stealing from your business. People who are always working long hours and never take a vacation. This “dedication” is a front for superiors. People who are stealing via their position do not want to be absent from the workplace for fear a temporary replacement might notice inconsistencies that could indicate fraud.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hyper-vigilance of connections</strong><ul><li>When an employee has a close personal connection/relationship with any vendor or associated financial institution, it’s usually not cause for concern of impropriety. However, hyper-vigilance or strong protection of those relationships, it’s possible there’s something in the business arrangement for this employee. One of the most common names for this kind of fraudulent arrangement is “kickbacks” or getting a cut of the profits vendors or financial institutions receive from a thieving employee.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Inflated expenses</strong><ul><li>This is one of the most common types of theft committed in the workplace. Line items on expense reports are either inflated or fabricated entirely in order to pad the thief’s pocket.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Extravagances</strong><ul><li>Payroll knows what individual employees make week to week, so when there are unexplained extravagences in an employee’s life, such as a flashy new car, it’s important HR keep an eye on said employee.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Frequent small transactions</strong><ul><li>Taking from petty cash in small amounts can add up quickly, and is often a sign of more serious, larger-scale fraud being committed within the company.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Entitlement</strong><ul><li>Employees who feel as though they are underpaid or undervalued at their company are also plausible perpetrators of theft. Whether as a motive or a rationalization, they feel as if what they stole was deserved payment.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>While theft can be an extremely toxic element in any work environment, one of the ways to exacerbate it is by conducting a poor internal investigation. Human Resource employees are unsung heroes of companies and businesses, as they are one of the crucial gatekeepers with control over the quality of employees. Not only are they very busy individuals, but they might not be the most objective persons to conduct an internal investigation.</p>



<p>Sometimes a lack of experience with investigations will cause a member of HR to make false or unprepared accusations about the guilt of a particular employee. If this employee is unimpeachable, the company can open itself up to lawsuits and bad press. Even if HR is not conducting the investigation, most employees are not trained investigators and might conduct an inquiry in an illegal manner that could also open the business up to litigation. Sometimes a pay cut for an employee suspected of stealing might seem like a quick and quiet way to resolve these issues, but legal counsel should always be consulted before making these decisions. By the same token, hasty termination of these employees to avoid a messy investigation should always involve the opinion of a legal expert—all in the name of protecting the country from plausible legal trouble.</p>



<p>The simple answer to avoiding all of the aforementioned ways to inflame an internal theft investigation is to retain the services of a private investigator. Private investigators can save companies from themselves in terms of opening themselves up to litigation or bad press. Private investigators have more skill and experience in these areas preventing investigations from blowing up in a negative manner. They are independent contractors, therefore, do not have a dog in the race when it comes to identifying the culprit of the theft. Their objectivity will be crucial, especially if the theft within the company goes all the way to the executive level. Because of their authority over employees, CEOs of companies might often get a soft front from HR or other investigative bodies within the business. Private investigators—being unknown to other employees in the business—can also conduct undercover operations to yield truthful and unbiased results. The private investigator, along with business counsel, can also advise Human Resource departments how to proceed once the culprit has been identified. Whatever the specific needs of a company, always consider hiring a private investigator to conduct internal investigations in order to protect and enhance the longevity of your business.</p>
