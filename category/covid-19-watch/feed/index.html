<p>Internal investigations during the pandemic have changed drastically. In unchartered territory, employers are desperate for the intelligence they need to make complex corporate decisions.</p>



<p>The novel COVID-19 coronavirus has forever altered the corporate landscape of our lives. In the beginning of the pandemic when America began sheltering in place, non-essential services and employees who were not furloughed or let go from their jobs moved their operations entirely online. As restrictions have relaxed in parts of the country over the last few months, employers are still having difficulties<a href="https://www.hoganlovells.com/~/media/hogan-lovells/pdf/2020-pdfs/2020_04_29_internal_investigations_during_covid_bloomberg.pdf"> navigating the challenges that COVID-19</a> continues to present. Now with the complications that arise from the threat of disease in the workplace, employers continue to seek ways to find peace of mind in uncertain times.</p>



<p>Because COVID-19 has placed restrictions on even the most essential of services, many types of court proceedings have been placed on hold while doctors and scientist combat the coronavirus. In addition, the landscape of day-to-day operations has also fundementally changed, with reduced hours, reduced staff, and a limited ability to properly address internal issues. In the interim, both employers and employees alike are left to twiddle their thumbs on either side of an issue or allegation. When COVID-19 restrictions lift, both employers and employees will still need to resolve these pervasive issues. A private investigator can be the ideal professional to find facts in these complicated <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-investigations/">corporate investigations </a>to fortify the case ahead of the COVID-19 restrictions being lifted.</p>



<p>When it comes to success in business, intelligence is the cornerstone of all progress. Knowledge is power, context is key, the more you know the better. Internal investigations during the pandemic definitely present their own set of challenges. While there is definitely intelligence to discovered in cyber investigations, or investigations that occur entirely in a digital capacity. Many background checks are themselves just cyber investigations, because the scope of the investigation does not expand beyond what is on the subject’s record. However, most investigation types call for some form of in-person evaluation from the private investigator. Perhaps the client needs worksite conditions documented, which would require the private investigator to travel to the worksite with surveillance equipment. It might become necessary for a private investigator to follow a subject to track their whereabouts. These types of in-person operations come with the risk of being exposed to the coronavirus. In economically lean times, resources can become stretched, time can become limited. However, COVID-19 still continues to present new opportunities for private intelligence.</p>



<p>Many offices and businesses are still operating at least in part online. Restrictions depend on the state, but many industries and positions are back to running operations in person at some level. These circumstances have left some employees still working from home, and others ion sick leave to fight or recuperate from illness. Despite the fact that these are unprecedented times, there are still dishonest persons who would seek to take advantage by malingering or stealing company time. When an employer has a reasonable suspicion of this employee misconduct, a private investigator is an ideal individual to get the answers. Private investigations during COVID-19 can be conducted quite safely, often times with one investigator fact-finding at a time to reduce spread. In this way, internal investigations do not have to be stalled in order to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. </p>



<p>Private investigators have a diverse tool chest that allows them to conduct covert investigations in plain sight. They are adept to blending in to any crowd, and have the experience necessary to go undercover at a worksite or similar circumstances. They can develop unique strategies for a myriad of investigations by virtue of their access to verified online databases. Private investigators can build comprehensive background checks on subjects and adjust their approach accordingly. If the employer is under reasonable suspicion that an employee is abusing the Family and Medical Leave Act, private investigators can conduct covert surveillance and develop rapport with relevant witnesses to confirm whether or not the subject is acting in accordance with their FMLA claim. The same can be said of worker’s compensation claims that are suspected of being fraudulent. At the conclusion of the investigation, private investigators prepare detailed reports and offer expert recommendations to their clients to ensure they have the crucial context they need to make complex business decisions.</p>
