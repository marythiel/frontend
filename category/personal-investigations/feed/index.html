<p>Romance scams have become a global problem, resulting in heartbreak and financial loss. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/02/love-stinks-when-scammer-involved">Federal Trade Commission</a>, consumers lost $1.14 billion to romance scams in 2023. The typical victim lost $4,400—an amount that could completely ruin many emotionally and financially—as scammers employ ever more advanced strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowledge of these frauds is vital not only for your financial and <strong>personal security</strong> but also for safeguarding your loved ones. By seeing red flags, encouraging <strong>scam prevention</strong>, and using resources like background checks, you may navigate internet interactions with more confidence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-romance-scams"><strong>Understanding Romance Scams</strong></h2>



<p>Romance scams are when con artists establish false internet identities to fool victims into starting love connections. Once confidence is built, con artists financially and emotionally prey on their victims. These programs can aim for those using social media, dating apps, or even professional networking sites.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Over 70,000 Americans were victims of romance scams in 2023.</li>



<li>Over the past five years, <strong>financial loss</strong> from these scams has doubled, reflecting fraudsters&#8217; developing expertise.</li>



<li>Targeting weaker populations, including elderly folks who might be less familiar with online safety measures, scammers increasingly prey on</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-tactics-used-by-romance-scammers"><strong>Common Tactics Used by Romance Scammers</strong></h2>



<p>Romance fraudsters control their victims by the use of several psychological and technological strategies. Knowing these techniques will keep you alert.</p>



<p><strong>Emotional Manipulation</strong></p>



<p>Early in the relationship, con artists sometimes declare their love to establish emotional reliance. To establish trust, they might say things such as, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never felt this way before&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re my soulmate.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Fabricated Emergencies</strong></p>



<p>One of the most often used strategies is creating problems by asking for financial aid. One such claim is that they are stranded overseas and require funds to get back home.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Notifying serious medical events needing quick money.</li>



<li>Declaring their company endeavor failed, they found themselves in a terrible financial situation.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Avoidance of Direct Interaction</strong></p>



<p>Often citing military deployment as their justification, scammers refuse to meet in person or engage in video chats.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Military deployment.</li>



<li>Remote employment sites</li>



<li>Technical issues with their equipment.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Requests for Money</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Many times, they want cash help via wire transfers.</li>



<li>Gift cards (which are untraceable).</li>



<li>Claiming either speed or safety, cryptocurrencies</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recognizing-red-flags-in-online-relationships"><strong>Recognizing Red Flags in Online Relationships</strong></h2>



<p>Early identification of questionable activities will help you avoid major emotional and financial damage. Here are critical indicators to be on the lookout for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Overwhelming Expressions of Love:</strong> Unusually fast expressions of love raise a serious red signal.</li>



<li><strong>Pressure to Act Immediately:</strong> Scammers may demand immediate cash assistance, saying lives depend on your actions.</li>



<li><strong>Discrepancies in Their Stories:</strong> Their stories often show differences in upbringing, work line, or location.</li>



<li><strong>Refusal to Meet:</strong> Genuine relationships entail actual engagement; con artists try to avoid this at all possible.</li>



<li><strong>Financial Assistance Requests:</strong> Any <strong>financial safety</strong> request—especially early in the relationship—is quite suspect.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-protect-yourself-from-romance-scams"><strong>How to Protect Yourself from Romance Scams?</strong></h2>



<p>Using proactive steps helps to prevent internet fraud:</p>



<p><strong>Practice Caution on Dating Platforms</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Dating apps and websites are common hunting grounds for fraud. Use sites that confirm user-profiles and provide online interaction safety advice.</p>



<p><strong>Verify Their Identity</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Look at their profile photos in a basic reverse image search to discover whether they are shared elsewhere. Often, scammers grab photographs from social media or stock photo websites.</p>



<p><strong>Avoid Sharing Personal Details</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Share less personal information online— avoid providing your address, place of employment, or bank records.</p>



<p><strong>Educate Yourself</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Stay updated on the most recent methods of fraud. Government and <strong>consumer protection</strong> agency websites often feature current data on internet fraud.</p>



<p><strong>Use Background Checks</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>A background check is among the best techniques for guaranteeing the validity of an online relationship. This service can reveal criminal records and is something Lauth Investigations International is well-versed at providing, as we can reveal the information below, and more:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Criminal history</li>



<li>Financial history</li>



<li>Residential history</li>



<li>Employment verification</li>



<li>Education credentials&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steps-to-take-if-you-suspect-a-scam"><strong>Steps to Take If You Suspect a Scam</strong></h2>



<p>Should you feel you have come across a romance scam, move fast to limit damage:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cut-Off Communication:</strong> Many times, scammers try to control victims into staying in the relationship.</li>



<li><strong>Report the Incident: </strong>Tell the following authorities:</li>



<li><strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC):</strong> Through their <strong>online fraud</strong> portal.</li>



<li><strong>Use Social Media Wisely</strong>: The platform you came up with the scammer on—perhaps attack on <strong>dating app safety</strong> or social media.</li>



<li><strong>Protect Your Finances:</strong> Call your credit card company or bank to stop purchases and track your accounts for unusual behavior.</li>



<li><strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> Ask private investigators to compile proof or verify the validity of your internet relationship.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>In this digital age, romance scams are a big problem because they play on people&#8217;s feelings and cause them to lose a lot of money. You may guard yourself and your loved ones by being alert, spotting red signals, and using background checks and other resources. Encouragement of scam awareness falls on all of us; by means of proactive actions, we may lower the prevalence of online fraud.</p>

<p>Genealogy is growing in popularity, with people worldwide diving into their ancestry to discover family connections and history. But as the interest in family research expands, so do common genealogy myths that can cloud the understanding of ancestry and mislead budding researchers. Here, we break down three popular myths to give people clear guidance as they embark on their family history journeys. Let’s engage in some genealogy myth-busting and set the record straight on these ancestry research misconceptions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="300" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-166396" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled.jpg 600w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Copy-of-Copy-of-Untitled-480x240.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-myth-1-our-family-name-has-always-been-spelled-the-same-way"><strong>Myth #1: “Our Family Name Has Always Been Spelled the Same Way”</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most persistent false family tree assumptions is that family surnames have been passed down without changes. People often believe that their ancestors’ names are identical to their own in spelling and pronunciation. However, due to a lack of standardized spelling in the past, surnames were often altered based on the person recording them.</p>



<p>Historically, record-keepers would write names as they heard them, resulting in significant variations. For instance, a surname like &#8220;Smith&#8221; could appear as &#8220;Smyth&#8221; or &#8220;Smythe.&#8221; This variation is particularly common among families who moved between countries, where language differences led to further adjustments in spelling. Therefore, when conducting ancestry research, it is essential to check multiple variations of family names and be open to different spellings across generations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-myth-2-all-family-records-can-be-found-online"><strong>Myth #2: “All Family Records Can Be Found Online”</strong></h2>



<p>Another ancestry research misconception is that all family history records are accessible online. While digitization has made genealogy more convenient, only a fraction of historical records are currently available online. Many documents, especially from smaller towns or older records from specific regions, may still exist only in physical archives. Local courthouses, libraries, or churches often contain valuable but undigitized records.</p>



<p>It’s also important to remember that certain records, like those about births, deaths, and marriages, might be protected by privacy laws. For recent generations, access to these documents may require proof of kinship or special permissions. When debunking family history myths, understanding these restrictions helps researchers set realistic expectations for the process.</p>



<p>Genealogists recommend visiting local archives or hiring a professional genealogy service, like Lauth Investigations, to access restricted or location-specific records that could reveal more detailed family history.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-myth-3-ancestry-tests-reveal-all-your-family-secrets"><strong>Myth</strong><strong> #3: “Ancestry Tests Reveal All Your Family Secrets”</strong></h2>



<p>The rise of DNA ancestry testing has led to another popular genealogy myth: the belief that a DNA test can tell you everything about your family background. While DNA tests can provide insights into general ethnic backgrounds and identify distant relatives, they cannot give a complete family tree or guarantee accurate connections to specific ancestors.</p>



<p>DNA results often present data in percentages and estimated family connections rather than exact lineage details. Additionally, these tests are limited by the databases they use—meaning results might change as more people take tests and the data expands. This common genealogy myth can lead to disappointment when people expect a simple DNA test to answer all their family questions.</p>



<p>For a well-rounded view of family history, experts suggest combining DNA results with traditional record-based research. Professional services like Lauth Investigations use a blend of record tracking and genetic research to build more comprehensive and accurate family trees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choosing-the-right-path-in-genealogy"><strong>Choosing the Right Path in Genealogy</strong></h2>



<p>Understanding these genealogy myths allows people to approach their ancestry research with realistic expectations and avoid falling into common pitfalls. When it comes to diving deep into a family’s past, patience, thorough research, and often professional assistance are essential.</p>



<p>For those looking to go beyond online records, Lauth Investigations offers professional genealogy services. With a team of experienced genealogists and access to a wide range of archives and databases, Lauth Investigations helps individuals and families uncover their heritage with accuracy and integrity. Their expertise not only aids in finding hard-to-access records but also brings insight into building detailed family histories.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="300" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Untitled-design-4.jpg" alt="jewelry thief holding stolen jewelry" class="wp-image-166392" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Untitled-design-4.jpg 600w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Untitled-design-4-480x240.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p>Jewelry holds sentimental value and often represents a significant financial investment. Unfortunately, it is also a common target for theft. Understanding the insurance limitations for jewelry theft is crucial in safeguarding your prized possessions. While many people believe that their homeowners or renters insurance covers all their valuable items, there are often restrictions that can leave you under-protected. Here are three important things you should know about insurance limitations and how Lauth Investigations International can assist with jewelry theft investigation and stolen jewelry recovery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-insurance-caps-on-jewelry-theft"><strong>1</strong><strong>. Insurance Caps on Jewelry Theft</strong></h2>



<p>Most standard homeowners and renters insurance policies have a cap on what they will cover for property theft, especially for high-value items like jewelry. For example, many policies only cover up to $1,500 for jewelry theft, regardless of the item’s value. This can be a major problem if your jewelry collection is worth much more.</p>



<p>Adding specific jewelry insurance or scheduled personal property coverage can help bridge this gap, but it’s important to understand that this comes at an extra cost. Even with added coverage, not all incidents of jewelry theft or jewelry robbery may be covered. For instance, many policies exclude coverage for jewelry theft that occurs while traveling internationally or for accidental loss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-homeowners-insurance-vs-stand-alone-jewelry-insurance"><strong>2</strong><strong>. Homeowners Insurance vs. Stand-Alone Jewelry Insurance</strong></h2>



<p>While homeowners or renters insurance offers some protection for jewelry theft, it is often limited to specific circumstances, such as property theft during a burglary. Stand-alone jewelry insurance policies can offer more comprehensive coverage, including for lost or misplaced jewelry, mysterious disappearances, and accidental damage. However, these policies also come with limitations that consumers need to be aware of.</p>



<p>For example, most policies do not cover jewelry robbery that involves intentional damage or loss, nor do they compensate for wear and tear or manufacturer defects. This makes it essential to read the fine print of your policy to ensure that you are fully protected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-the-role-of-professional-investigations-in-jewelry-theft-cases"><strong>3</strong><strong>. The Role of Professional Investigations in Jewelry Theft Cases</strong></h2>



<p>If you experience jewelry theft, navigating the claims process with your insurance provider can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience. Even worse, many insurance claims are denied if the jewelry theft investigation doesn&#8217;t meet the insurer’s standards. This is where professional investigation services like those provided by Lauth Investigations International can be invaluable.</p>



<p>Lauth Investigations International specializes in stolen jewelry recovery and jewelry theft investigation. Their team of experts has a proven track record in successfully recovering stolen items, especially in cases where police efforts may fall short. With extensive experience in tracking down stolen art and valuable items, Lauth Investigations International is equipped to handle even the most complex cases of property theft.</p>



<p>Their expertise is not just limited to domestic jewelry theft; they also handle international cases where stolen jewelry has been moved across borders. They employ various advanced techniques, including surveillance, asset tracking, and working with global networks to retrieve stolen items. Whether it&#8217;s a case of jewelry robbery or a more subtle disappearance, Lauth Investigations International provides comprehensive support from start to finish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-your-jewelry-what-you-can-do"><strong>Protecting</strong><strong> Your Jewelry: What You Can Do?</strong></h2>



<p>While insurance can provide some peace of mind, the best way to protect your jewelry is by being proactive. Here are a few simple tips to minimize the risk of jewelry theft:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Store valuable pieces in a secure location, such as a home safe or a safe deposit box.</li>



<li>Avoid wearing expensive jewelry in public places where thefts are more likely.</li>



<li>Regularly update your insurance to reflect the current value of your items.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the unfortunate event of a jewelry theft, remember that insurance claims are only part of the solution. Recovering stolen items requires a dedicated team of investigators who know how to track down valuable assets and work with authorities to ensure they are returned to their rightful owners. Lauth Investigations International offers the expertise you need to navigate this challenging process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Emotions can run high where child custody is concerned. Parents often face difficult decisions, and sometimes, they may need outside help to ensure the best outcome for their child. This is where child custody investigations come into play. These investigations are vital to make sure that the child&#8217;s well-being is the top priority. In this blog, we will explore what child custody investigations are, why they are important, and how they help in making the best decisions for children.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-child-custody-investigations"><strong>What is a Child Custody Investigations?</strong></h2>



<p>A child custody investigation is an inquiry into the living conditions, behaviors, and overall environment in which a child is being raised. The goal of the investigation is to provide a clear picture of the child’s well-being and to ensure that they are in a safe, loving, and supportive environment. Investigators gather evidence, observe interactions, and conduct interviews with people who are close to the child, such as family members, teachers, and neighbors.</p>



<p>These investigations are typically ordered by a court during a custody dispute or when there is concern about the child’s safety or welfare. The findings from the investigation can play a crucial role in determining which parent will have custody, or what the visitation arrangements will be.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-child-custody-investigations-important"><strong>Why Are Child Custody Investigations Important?</strong></h2>



<p>Child custody investigations are important because they provide an unbiased assessment of a child&#8217;s living situation. When parents are going through a separation or divorce, emotions can cloud judgment. Each parent may believe that they are the best choice for custody, but an investigator can provide a neutral perspective based on facts and observations.</p>



<p>These investigations are crucial when there are allegations of abuse, neglect, or substance abuse. If a child’s safety is at risk, it is essential to have a thorough investigation to ensure they are not placed in a harmful environment. Investigators can uncover evidence that may not be apparent to the court otherwise, such as poor living conditions, inappropriate behavior, or negative influences that could impact the child’s development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Does a Child Custody Investigator Do?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeEkut5xkWC2FTML_ZI3W8MUxFOr68AHCCBYY36wuvQBRDBQEYqdwdY7vKwnrlg3FJgPifokwyrcElehvX94UAQDQvp0_AOh57jWuf1jzQtlRZIqL2OZetDZNP54lLenucIUSB2T1npQXPshin5kC_81_eUQ_xwMJpk0-j9xfXJl8gM29xBcBo?key=PtGqiirCDIYIncA6123HEg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>A child custody investigator’s job is to gather information and report their findings to the court. They use various methods to ensure they have a comprehensive view of the child’s situation. Some of the tasks they perform include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Observing Interactions:</strong> Investigators often observe the interactions between the child and each parent. They look at how the child behaves around each parent, how the parents communicate with the child, and whether the child seems happy, comfortable, and well-cared for.</li>



<li><strong>Conducting Relevant Interviews:</strong> To get a full picture, investigators may interview people who are close to the child. This could include teachers, daycare providers, family members, and neighbors. These interviews help the investigator understand the child’s daily life and whether there are any concerns about their well-being.</li>



<li><strong>Checking Living Conditions:</strong> Investigators visit the homes of both parents to check the living conditions. They look at the cleanliness, safety, and appropriateness of the home for raising a child. They may also check whether the child has their own space, such as a bedroom, and whether the home is childproofed to prevent accidents.</li>



<li><strong>Reviewing Documents:</strong> In some cases, investigators may review documents related to the child’s care. This could include medical records, school reports, or records of any previous incidents involving child services. These documents can provide important insights into the child’s health, education, and overall well-being.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Happens After the Investigation?</strong></h2>



<p>Once the investigation is complete, the investigator will compile a report detailing their findings. This report is submitted to the court and is used by the judge to make informed decisions about custody and visitation arrangements. The report will include the investigator’s observations, the information gathered from interviews, and any other relevant evidence.</p>



<p>The judge will use this report, along with other evidence presented in the case, to decide what is in the best interests of the child. The best interest of the child is the guiding principle in custody cases, meaning that the court’s decision should always prioritize the child’s health, safety, and overall well-being.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Common Scenarios Where a Child Custody Investigation Is Needed</strong></h2>



<p>Child custody investigations are not always necessary, but they are often required in specific situations. Some common scenarios where an investigation might be needed include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Allegations of Abuse or Neglect:</strong> If there are allegations that a child is being abused or neglected by one of the parents, an investigation is essential to determine the truth. The safety of the child is the top priority, and the investigation can help the court ensure that the child is not placed in a harmful environment.</li>



<li><strong>Concerns About Substance Abuse:</strong> If one parent is suspected of using drugs or alcohol excessively, it could impact their ability to care for the child. An investigation can provide evidence of substance abuse, such as observations of behavior, testimonies from witnesses, or even drug testing.</li>



<li><strong>Parental Alienation:</strong> Sometimes, one parent may try to turn the child against the other parent, a behavior known as parental alienation. This can be harmful to the child’s emotional well-being and can influence the court’s decision on custody. An investigation can help identify signs of parental alienation and provide recommendations to protect the child.</li>



<li><strong>Disputes Over Living Arrangements:</strong> In some cases, parents may disagree over where the child should live. One parent might believe the other’s home is not suitable for raising a child. An investigation can assess the living conditions and provide a clear picture of which home is better suited for the child’s needs.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Can Child Custody Investigations Benefit the Child?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf-nSMcsmdJT7XUlqlDJdJvwh5ispCX2K1ec0scrAD0PRDDV1CZO0sQGOxdAnOHcBXcZ4zSqCBSgXdv4LlT-i4SSmQdDl-ldCVDx0sUL66CA7sDWaW2SafIMd1D2xHotnWe-QcO4ZJ1jk1db-lwejE4rLKGZkDfupKSh_qV5PKLBatLRLXK7g?key=PtGqiirCDIYIncA6123HEg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The primary benefit of a child custody investigation is that it helps ensure the child’s best interests are met. When a court has all the necessary information, it can make better decisions that prioritize the child’s safety, happiness, and well-being. Here’s how these investigations benefit the child:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ensuring Safety:</strong> If there are concerns about abuse, neglect, or other dangers, an investigation can provide the evidence needed to protect the child. This might mean placing the child with the parent who can provide a safer and more nurturing environment.</li>



<li><strong>Supporting Emotional Well-Being:</strong> Children can be deeply affected by their parents&#8217; conflicts. An investigation can identify any emotional harm caused by the parents’ actions, such as parental alienation, and recommend solutions to support the child’s emotional health.</li>



<li><strong>Providing Stability:</strong> Courts aim to provide stability in a child’s life. An investigation can help determine which parent is better able to provide a stable and consistent environment, which is crucial for the child’s development.</li>
</ul>



<p>Child custody investigations play a vital role in protecting children during custody disputes. They ensure that the court has a full understanding of the child’s situation and can make decisions that truly serve the child’s best interests. By providing a clear and unbiased picture of the child’s environment, these investigations help create outcomes that prioritize the child’s safety, happiness, and overall well-being.</p>

<p>Have you ever had the feeling you were being watched? Perhaps the hairs on the back of your neck stood up, and you paused for a moment, before brushing the feeling aside. It was probably just paranoia—unless, of course, there was a reason why a private investigator might have been surveilling you as part of their infidelity investigations.</p>



<p>Cheating spouse investigations are one of the most common tasks involving the use of surveillance techniques and technologies undertaken by personal investigators. Although, these types of investigations can be mounted for all manner of other reasons, including over family law matters, suspected abuse or theft by domestic staff, or dishonest dealings within a workplace setting.</p>



<p>Today, we&#8217;re going to take a look at why cheating spouse investigations arise so often in the world of private investigators, as well as the kinds of technology and techniques that your trusted PI might use to get to the truth of the matter.</p>



<p><strong>Is Your Spouse Being Disloyal?</strong></p>



<p>If you can&#8217;t shake the feeling that your husband or wife is running around behind your back, there&#8217;s good reason to investigate further. The tough truth is that research suggests that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J398v01n03_03">50-60% of married men and 45-55% of married women</a> will veer into the realms of extramarital sex in their lifetimes, and these statistics don&#8217;t even cover non-traditional types of infidelity, such as those seeking out virtual erotic encounters.</p>



<p>Warning signs that might alert you to the possibility that you other half is doing the dirty include suspicious internet and phone use, changes to their appearance and bathing habits, a shift in work routine, and changes in your own intimate relationship—including, perhaps surprisingly, an increase in sexual interest. When red flags are appearing, some may feel comfortable confronting their spouse, but others prefer to confirm of disprove their worries covertly. This is where a private investigator can assist in discreetly gathering evidence that will close the matter once and for all.</p>



<p><strong>What is Involved in Cheating Spouse Investigations?</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of launching into infidelity investigations, a private investigator will meet their client in order to ascertain not only the suspected behavior in question, but also as much background information as possible, such as daily routine, habits, hobbies, and social connections. The full scope of this kind of investigative process can be very painful for the client, making discretion, delicacy, and compassion essential qualities in a PI handling cheating spouse investigations.</p>



<p>With background information gathered, the private investigator you hire will begin using surveillance techniques to observe your spouse and document their behavior. Once they have gathered enough evidence for you to be able to draw a solid conclusion, they will present their findings and you can decide how to proceed.</p>



<p><strong>The Spectrum of Surveillance Technology</strong></p>



<p>Surveillance can be an optimally effective way to yield the information that infidelity investigations—and indeed countless other investigation types—call to uncover. However, it is essential to work with a fully licensed and reputable private investigations firm, because the legality of surveillance is complex, and the letter of the law must always be followed. The right investigative experts will know the specifics of each state&#8217;s unique legal requirements, allowing them to choose the surveillance options that will safeguard the client&#8217;s interests rather than landing them in hot water.</p>



<p>Technologies harnessed by private investigators include so-called nanny cams, which are so small that they can be easily concealed in the home or workplace without occupants being any the wiser. Hidden cameras can also be worn on the body, and even built into smart glasses, making video surveillance easier than ever. Other technologies that may be enlisted include recording devices and GPS tracking devices, however, once again, respective legislation must always be adhered to. A personal investigator may also surveil behavior online and physically observe the suspect&#8217;s actions to better understand the facts.<br></p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="955" height="1024" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/common_58135709-955x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-134195"/></figure></div>



<p>There&#8217;s a romantic notion of what private investigators might look like—thanks to the long history of fascinating fictional characters in literature, cinema, and television. Picture the sweep of a long overcoat, a tilted fedora, and dramatically shaded scenes of late-night stakeouts!&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the fantasy is fun to imagine, in reality, contemporary private investigators perform a vast array of essential functions—serving as a vital resource for private citizens, businesses, and organizations alike. More importantly, because a large part of their work involves blending in, any stranger passing you in the street could be a private detective on the case. If you find yourself asking, <em>“Are there private investigators near me right now?”</em>, the answer is probably yes!</p>



<p>Of course, there&#8217;s no need to to start looking over your shoulder just yet! Simply because there are local private investigators busy at work, uncovering the truth of one matter or another, doesn&#8217;t mean that they are on your tail specifically. In fact, the best private investigation services cover a broad exploratory scope. In answer to the question, <em>“What do private investigators do?”</em>, lets explore some of the types of private investigations that this discreet professional might engage in. Perhaps among them is the very service that you require!</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Attorney and Legal Support</strong></li></ol>



<p>You might be surprised to know that many law firms turn to private detective services in order to build better cases. Because private investigators have access to many of the same databases as law enforcement, and are experts in seeking information, locating witnesses, and diligently compiling data, they are an ideal ally for any attorney working a complex case against the clock.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"><li><strong>Missing Persons</strong></li></ol>



<p>When someone goes missing, there are any number of reasons why law enforcement might not pour the necessary resources into tracking them down. Hiring a private investigator means setting someone to the task who will dedicate themselves entirely to locating the individual in questions—even if international travel is required.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"><li><strong>Background Checks</strong></li></ol>



<p>These days, companies can&#8217;t be too careful about who they hire or who their business partners are. Sadly, we live in an era of corporate fraud, intellectual property theft, and more. So many organizations turn to private investigation services for a higher caliber of background check than their HR departments would be able to achieve.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"><li><strong>Heir Searches</strong></li></ol>



<p>The line of inheritance is not always a simple thing, and often the destiny of an estate is placed on hold because rightful heirs are unknown or unlocated. In these moments, the best private investigator around will be uniquely suited to finding that individual, harnessing the same skills that they would for any missing person or witness location investigation.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="5"><li><strong>Divorce and Child Custody Cases</strong></li></ol>



<p>Both divorce and child custody cases can become messy business when parties do not agree—and particularly when there is a disparity in power or resources. When an obvious crime hasn&#8217;t been committed, building a solid case can be a challenge. In these instances, a private investigator can help to form an iron clad picture of the reality of the situation, facilitating more favorable judgments for their clients.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="6"><li><strong>Corporate Intelligence</strong></li></ol>



<p>Concerned that a non-compete agreement has been breached or intellectual property has been appropriated? Wanting to get a clear picture of a competitors current strategy or a company&#8217;s credentials ahead of a merger? Local private investigators can illuminate the truth through corporate intelligence gathering.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="7"><li><strong>Security Analysis</strong></li></ol>



<p>From digital security to on-site safety, a private investigation firm is a likely port of call for businesses hoping to find any holes in their defenses. Better yet, a trusted investigator with expertise in this area will be able to advise on how to enhance security to its full potential.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="8"><li><strong>Workplace Investigations</strong></li></ol>



<p>While many larger organizations have am HR department that can carry out workplace investigations when something untoward occurs, they still might choose to outsource the task to private investigators. This is because a private detective is an impartial presence, so their evidence gathering and ultimate testimony can offer greater protection against liability should the investigation result in litigation.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="9"><li><strong>Art and Jewelry Theft</strong></li></ol>



<p>Oftentimes, law enforcement agencies simply don&#8217;t have the resources to chase down precious and sentimental valuables, inevitably placing greater focus on solving violent crimes. When something treasured vanishes, hiring a private investigation firm offers peace of mind that pursuit is still underway, making recovering the stolen items is more likely.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="10"><li><strong>Corporate Culture Audits</strong></li></ol>



<p>Rather than waiting until signs of cultural deterioration start to manifest in the form of workplace theft, malingering, or worse, businesses are increasingly turning to private investigation services to analyze and improve their corporate culture proactively.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="11"><li><strong>Good Ol&#8217; Surveillance</strong></li></ol>



<p>The roles above only scratch the surface of what private investigators do within today&#8217;s society. Of course, you can always trust that they continue to covertly carry out surveillance whenever an investigation warrants it! That said, while the endeavor might be old fashioned in its sentimentality, contemporary surveillance is a pretty high-tech affair.<br>Did any of those activities surprise you?

<p>During the 2020 pandemic, people throughout the globe were struggling with detachment from their family, friends, and coworkers. In search of a connection with another human being, it should be no surprise that more than a few people would fall victim to online romance scams. However, in a shocking report by the Federal Trade Commission, losses due to romance scams increased by 50%. Romance scams have dominated the top position on the FTC’s list of fraud scams. More money is lost annually to romance scams than any other type of fraud in the United States. Since 2016, reports of romance scams have tripled, and the total dollar amounts lost have quadrupled. Given this alarming spike in numbers, it’s worth refreshing your knowledge on how these <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/catfish-romance-scams-2019/">romance scams</a> work and who is at risk for being a target.</p>



<p>Most are familiar with the timeline of an online romance scam. News stories and talk show segments about lonely people being “catfished” by online scammers are everywhere, and the number of these incidents appears to be on the rise. The reason for this rise in romance scams can be two-fold. To begin, the isolation of the pandemic in efforts to flatting the proverbial curve left many individuals with a desire to reach out and connect with another human being online. The internet is where romance scams thrive, and users who are attempting to scrape the bottom of the barrel of human interaction can be easy targets for criminals. In the same vein, following the COVID-19 restrictions that kept many Americans completely isolated from the outside world initiated an increase in internet usage. Without routine, in-person interactions with friends, family, and coworkers, individuals who were not habitual internet or social media users—or even internet literate—flocked to the world wide web in search of some form of human connection.</p>



<p>This perfect storm of circumstances created a perfect hunting ground for internet scammers to hook promising marks who could fill their virtual pocketbooks with cash and other assets. In the days before Facebook, online romance scams typically started on internet forums or in chatrooms. Now, scammers have fully adapted to the ways and language of social media. With Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat dominating the way we communicate, it’s easier than ever to bilk someone out of their hard-earned money in an online romance scam.</p>



<p>It is not a matter of if, but when these criminals will ask for money, and the longer you look at case studies for these online romance scams, the more colorful the reasons get. Sometimes the scammer claims they need funds to keep their phone or internet service connected—and therefore keep them connected to their mark. Sometimes the scammer will claim they need money to get out of a perilous situation so they can allegedly return to the United States and finally meet up with the mark in person. Regardless of the reason, there are almost always suspicious methods of getting this money to the scammer, such as wiring the money to another person whose name does not match the scammer’s persona. Or perhaps the money must be sent to a bank account in an unexpected part of the world.</p>



<p>Even more staggering is that the FTC’s data on the rise in online romance scams indicates that no age group is immune to these operations. The number of online romance scams went up in all age brackets of potential victims. In fact, according to the FTC, people between the ages of 20 and 29 saw the biggest increase in being targeted, while people 70 and older were reporting the highest losses in the neighborhood of $10,000. With so much at stake in online dating, it’s imperative that you know how to protect yourself from these scammers. Here are the FTC’s tips for avoiding online romance scams:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>&nbsp;Never send money or gifts to someone you haven’t met in person – even if they send you money first.</li><li>Talk to someone you trust about this new love interest. It can be easy to miss things that don’t add up. So pay attention if your friends or family are concerned.</li><li>Take it slowly. Ask questions and look for inconsistent answers.</li><li>Try a reverse-image search of the profile pictures. If they’re associated with another name or with details that don’t match up, it’s a scam.</li><li>Learn more at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/romancescams">ftc.gov/romancescams</a>.</li></ul>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/most-common-sig_53831159-504x1024.png" alt="most common signs of a cheating spouse" class="wp-image-133747" width="373" height="758"/></figure></div>



<p>What <em>are</em> the most common signs of a cheating spouse? Some people think they have an instinct for these things—that they know their partner, and they know when something is not right—and can identify behaviors as suspicious when they are actually innocuous. In order to get crystal clear clarification on whether or not your partner or spouse is being unfaithful, you’ll need a seasoned private investigator.</p>



<p>One of the most famed tasks of private investigators in popular media is hiring a private investigator to find out if a spouse is cheating. Private investigators are famous for following spouses who are suspected of infidelity, documenting their movements, reviewing their financial records, and providing comprehensive reports for the client’s use in an subsequent legal action. However, not every suspicion of infidelity might be cause for hiring a private investigator. From the experts at Lauth Investigations International, here are the most common signs of a cheating spouse.</p>



<p><strong>Decrease in affection or intimac</strong>y: Intimacy comes in many forms in a relationship, and they are not always sexual in nature. Each couple has their love languages and their personal ways of showing affection to one another. Significant decreases in these forms of affection and intimacy could be a sign that your partner is having these needs filled by another person. This could come in the form of either a physical or emotional affair.</p>



<p><strong>Questionable cell phone and internet use:</strong> Everyone is entitled to their privacy, but within a relationship, there must be a level of transparency and communication that inspires trust. If your partner or spouse is being secretive with their phone and internet habits, it is possible its because they have something to hide. Affairs do not have to be physical. Individuals can conduct illicit relationships over the internet and through text messaging. A constant clearing of the browser history may also be cause for alarm.</p>



<p><strong>Drastic changes in appearance and hygiene:</strong> It’s not uncommon for cheaters to suddenly undergo drastic changes to their physical appearance when they are having an affair. Sure, one haircut does not mean your spouse or partner is cheating on you, but changes in hair, wardrobe, and workout routine all at the same time may be a red flag as well. In the case of physical affairs, cheaters are known to cover their tracks by increasing the frequency of bathing and opting for strong perfumes and colognes to cover unexplainable odors.</p>



<p><strong>Increased working hours:</strong> “Working late” is by far one of the most common excuses for cheating spouses that exists. Partners and spouses use the cover of longer working hours because it is a convenient reason to be absent from the home or from the phone, and their significant other will likely not question their absence because they are earning a living.</p>



<p>If only one of these signs is present in the relationship, there could be a simple explanation. In the case of secretive device use—it’s possible your spouse or partner is planning some kind of surprise; maybe a gift, a party, or a vacation. A decrease in intimacy could be a sign of depression or illness. However, if you or someone you love is experiencing two or more of these most common signs of a cheating spouse, it may be time to call a private investigator and get the answers you need.</p>



<p>Life is difficult enough without embarking on a mission to expose your spouse’s cheating ways. We all have jobs, families, and hobbies that we’d much rather devote time to instead of playing junior private detective. If you suspect your spouse is cheating, it’s time to hire a private investigator. Private investigators have diverse experience in surveillance and field operations and know the sophisticated methodology behind following a person without being noticed. Because they will be a stranger to your family, this dramatically increases the likelihood your spouse will never know they’re being followed. Infidelity investigations are unique in the sense that if the client in question is the subject’s spouse, the client can give a private investigator access to documents that they might not otherwise be able to locate, such as specific bank records or sealed court documents. Private investigators can photograph or record your spouse or partner’s infidelity, compile the evidence along with additional relevant information, and even serve as an expert witness in any legal proceedings that occur as a result of the conclusion of the investigation.</p>
