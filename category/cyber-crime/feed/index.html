<p>Employee <strong>intellectual property</strong> (IP) theft has grown to be a major issue in a society going more and more technologically advanced. The dangers to private data have increased as more businesses choose digital collaboration and remote work. Employee misbehavior involving sensitive firm data—that is, insider threats—may cause significant financial and reputation harm. This article looks at sensible ways businesses may protect their intellectual property, stop internal threats, and react fast when needed. By means of practical illustrations and Lauth Investigations&#8217; services, companies can better grasp how to safeguard their most valuable assets.</p>



<p><strong>The Rise of Insider Threats</strong></p>



<p>Though they are nothing new, the frequency of insider threats has risen as the workplace has changed. According to a Ponemon Institute analysis as of 2023 insiders account for around <a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/isaca-now-blog/2024/why-so-many-organizations-underestimate-insider-threats#:~:text=Approximately%2060%20percent%20of%20data,policies%20or%20opening%20new%20vulnerabilities.">60% of all data breaches</a>. This alarming figure shows the extent of the risk businesses. Employee access to private company data increases the likelihood of misuse—intentional or inadvertent. Particularly remote work has grown the digital footprint and given additional chances for internal data leaks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Rising Concern in Remote Work</strong></h3>



<p>Companies have less control over the physical security of their workspaces if workers operate from home or another off-site venue. While remote work solutions include cloud storage, shared document files, and collaboration platforms boost employee comfort of work, they also enable simpler access, transfer, and occasionally inappropriate data access. In these situations, insider dangers are more elusive to find. Standard security protocols might not be enough. This change emphasizes the need for revised, aggressive plans to protect intellectual property.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Real-World Example: Tesla’s Insider Threat Case</strong></h3>



<p>Tesla made news in 2023 when a staff member allegedly stole confidential data on its Autopilot program. Allegatively trying to sell the company&#8217;s valuable data to a rival, the employee downloaded private files. Through its internal security monitoring systems, Tesla discovered the individual&#8217;s actions and set out an alert when massive data access and transfer without appropriate authorization occurred. This situation shows the rising danger of insider threats and the need of having robust digital monitoring measures in place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategy 1: Establish Strong Access Controls</strong></h2>



<p>Tight access limitations are among the best strategies to safeguard intellectual property. This means making sure intellectual property and sensitive data are only accessed by authorised staff.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limiting Access Based on Roles</strong></h3>



<p>Least privilege should be the guiding concept for design of access limitations. Employees should only be able to access the data they actually need to carry out their job obligations. A software engineer working on a particular module, for instance, shouldn&#8217;t have access to a product&#8217;s whole source code. Businesses can drastically lower the likelihood of internal data theft by cutting the number of persons having access to private information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication</strong></h3>



<p>By guaranteeing that staff members access critical data only after passing through several security gates, multi-factor authentication (MFA) offers still another layer of protection. MFA allows one to prevent unwanted access even in cases of compromised login credentials for an employee. Companies can demand, for instance, a second authentication method—a phone-based code or biometric verification.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regularly Reviewing Access Permissions</strong></h3>



<p>Access control cannot be fixed once-only. Regular audits help to guarantee that staff members still have access to the data they have been assigned. Review and alter access rights as responsibilities evolve or staff members go. Lauth Investigations provides services to audit internal security policies of a firm, therefore assisting to find any weaknesses in access restrictions and suggest fixes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategy 2: Educate Employees on IP Security</strong></h2>



<p>Stopping insider risks depends mostly on employee training. Lack of knowledge causes many breaches when staff members unintentionally reveal intellectual property.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conduct Regular Training and Awareness Programs</strong></h3>



<p>Businesses should set up continuous training courses to inform staff members on the dangers of intellectual property theft, phishing campaigns, and safe handling of private information. Employees should also be informed of the policies of the company on IP protection and the results of violating these policies. Frequent employee testing via fake scenarios or simulated phishing attempts can also support strong security practices.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Promote a Security-First Culture</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond instruction, businesses have to create a security-first culture whereby staff members personally commit themselves to protect private data. This entails pushing staff members to document possible weaknesses they come across or suspected behavior. Employees are more likely to follow security procedures and be alert when they realize that safeguarding intellectual property is a corporate top concern.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Example: The Microsoft Insider Theft Incident</strong></h3>



<p>Microsoft had a security hack in 2023 in which an employee—who had received training on safeguarding private data—was accused of copying proprietary software code to sell it to a third party. The staff ignored the security systems even though they were in existence. This situation emphasizes the need of combining an informed workforce with effective security technologies. Although Microsoft found the problem fast thanks to training, more strict use of security policies may have completely avoided the intrusion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategy 3: Utilize Digital Monitoring and Analytics</strong></h2>



<p>Preventing insider threats mostly depends on proactive monitoring of employee behavior. Although this approach seems invasive, it is necessary to find and react to possible security breaches before they do major damage.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monitoring Digital Footprints</strong></h3>



<p>Particularly when employees access, download, or share private company data, companies should use tools tracking staff members&#8217; digital behavior. This can cover tracking email exchanges, cloud storage use, file transfers, and even actual USB drives. These digital monitoring technologies help companies identify odd activity, including viewing vast amounts of data outside of an employee&#8217;s purview.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Setting Up Alerts for Suspicious Activity</strong></h3>



<p>Automated alarms can be configured to inform IT teams anytime dubious activity takes place. For instance, the technology can instantly set off an alarm for inquiry should an employee access private files or download vast volumes of data outside of business hours. This fast reaction helps to stop data theft or compromise before it is too late.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Example: The Google Employee Data Theft Case</strong></h3>



<p>A Google employee was discovered in 2023 to have been accessing private product data unrelated to their line of employment. Google was able to stop the staff member from distributing the data to outside parties by flagging the unusual access through the company&#8217;s digital monitoring systems. This example shows the need of making investments in digital monitoring instruments to guarantee data protection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategy 4: Conduct Background Checks and Vet Employees</strong></h2>



<p>A key chance for businesses to stop internal risks is the employment process. Reducing the danger of IP theft can be achieved by first making sure staff members are reliable before allowing access to private information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Background Checks for New Hires</strong></h3>



<p>Before recruiting staff, especially for positions involving access to private data, extensive background checks are absolutely vital. This can cover verifying references, past employment histories, and criminal records. In high-risk situations, businesses could also wish to look closer at the prior behavior of an applicant.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vetting Contractors and Temporary Staff</strong></h3>



<p>Before being granted access to private information, even contractors and temporary personnel should be thoroughly screened. Many businesses ignore this phase since they believe that only full-time staff members represent a hazard. But, especially if they have access to corporate networks or private data, contractors could potentially have the chance to pilfer or use intellectual property.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lauth Investigations’ Role in Employee Vetting</strong></h3>



<p>Lauth Investigations offers services designed to assist businesses in screening possible employees or contractors and evaluating their dependability. Background checks, fraud investigations, and other ways of confirming the integrity of people with access to private business data constitute part of their offerings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Businesses in the digital environment of today must first give protecting intellectual property from insider threats top importance. Companies have to be proactive in protecting their most important assets as remote work and growing dependence on digital technologies call for. Strong access limits, staff education, digital monitoring, and extensive background checks help companies reduce IP theft risk. Real-world situations such as the Microsoft and Tesla ones show how crucial strong security systems are. Professional investigative services, such those provided by Lauth Investigations, assist businesses to increase their defenses and guarantee that their intellectual property stays safe from insider threats.<br></p>

<p>Romance scams have become a global problem, resulting in heartbreak and financial loss. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/02/love-stinks-when-scammer-involved">Federal Trade Commission</a>, consumers lost $1.14 billion to romance scams in 2023. The typical victim lost $4,400—an amount that could completely ruin many emotionally and financially—as scammers employ ever more advanced strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowledge of these frauds is vital not only for your financial and <strong>personal security</strong> but also for safeguarding your loved ones. By seeing red flags, encouraging <strong>scam prevention</strong>, and using resources like background checks, you may navigate internet interactions with more confidence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-romance-scams"><strong>Understanding Romance Scams</strong></h2>



<p>Romance scams are when con artists establish false internet identities to fool victims into starting love connections. Once confidence is built, con artists financially and emotionally prey on their victims. These programs can aim for those using social media, dating apps, or even professional networking sites.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Over 70,000 Americans were victims of romance scams in 2023.</li>



<li>Over the past five years, <strong>financial loss</strong> from these scams has doubled, reflecting fraudsters&#8217; developing expertise.</li>



<li>Targeting weaker populations, including elderly folks who might be less familiar with online safety measures, scammers increasingly prey on</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-tactics-used-by-romance-scammers"><strong>Common Tactics Used by Romance Scammers</strong></h2>



<p>Romance fraudsters control their victims by the use of several psychological and technological strategies. Knowing these techniques will keep you alert.</p>



<p><strong>Emotional Manipulation</strong></p>



<p>Early in the relationship, con artists sometimes declare their love to establish emotional reliance. To establish trust, they might say things such as, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never felt this way before&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re my soulmate.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Fabricated Emergencies</strong></p>



<p>One of the most often used strategies is creating problems by asking for financial aid. One such claim is that they are stranded overseas and require funds to get back home.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Notifying serious medical events needing quick money.</li>



<li>Declaring their company endeavor failed, they found themselves in a terrible financial situation.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Avoidance of Direct Interaction</strong></p>



<p>Often citing military deployment as their justification, scammers refuse to meet in person or engage in video chats.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Military deployment.</li>



<li>Remote employment sites</li>



<li>Technical issues with their equipment.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Requests for Money</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Many times, they want cash help via wire transfers.</li>



<li>Gift cards (which are untraceable).</li>



<li>Claiming either speed or safety, cryptocurrencies</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recognizing-red-flags-in-online-relationships"><strong>Recognizing Red Flags in Online Relationships</strong></h2>



<p>Early identification of questionable activities will help you avoid major emotional and financial damage. Here are critical indicators to be on the lookout for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Overwhelming Expressions of Love:</strong> Unusually fast expressions of love raise a serious red signal.</li>



<li><strong>Pressure to Act Immediately:</strong> Scammers may demand immediate cash assistance, saying lives depend on your actions.</li>



<li><strong>Discrepancies in Their Stories:</strong> Their stories often show differences in upbringing, work line, or location.</li>



<li><strong>Refusal to Meet:</strong> Genuine relationships entail actual engagement; con artists try to avoid this at all possible.</li>



<li><strong>Financial Assistance Requests:</strong> Any <strong>financial safety</strong> request—especially early in the relationship—is quite suspect.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-protect-yourself-from-romance-scams"><strong>How to Protect Yourself from Romance Scams?</strong></h2>



<p>Using proactive steps helps to prevent internet fraud:</p>



<p><strong>Practice Caution on Dating Platforms</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Dating apps and websites are common hunting grounds for fraud. Use sites that confirm user-profiles and provide online interaction safety advice.</p>



<p><strong>Verify Their Identity</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Look at their profile photos in a basic reverse image search to discover whether they are shared elsewhere. Often, scammers grab photographs from social media or stock photo websites.</p>



<p><strong>Avoid Sharing Personal Details</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Share less personal information online— avoid providing your address, place of employment, or bank records.</p>



<p><strong>Educate Yourself</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Stay updated on the most recent methods of fraud. Government and <strong>consumer protection</strong> agency websites often feature current data on internet fraud.</p>



<p><strong>Use Background Checks</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>A background check is among the best techniques for guaranteeing the validity of an online relationship. This service can reveal criminal records and is something Lauth Investigations International is well-versed at providing, as we can reveal the information below, and more:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Criminal history</li>



<li>Financial history</li>



<li>Residential history</li>



<li>Employment verification</li>



<li>Education credentials&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steps-to-take-if-you-suspect-a-scam"><strong>Steps to Take If You Suspect a Scam</strong></h2>



<p>Should you feel you have come across a romance scam, move fast to limit damage:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cut-Off Communication:</strong> Many times, scammers try to control victims into staying in the relationship.</li>



<li><strong>Report the Incident: </strong>Tell the following authorities:</li>



<li><strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC):</strong> Through their <strong>online fraud</strong> portal.</li>



<li><strong>Use Social Media Wisely</strong>: The platform you came up with the scammer on—perhaps attack on <strong>dating app safety</strong> or social media.</li>



<li><strong>Protect Your Finances:</strong> Call your credit card company or bank to stop purchases and track your accounts for unusual behavior.</li>



<li><strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> Ask private investigators to compile proof or verify the validity of your internet relationship.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>In this digital age, romance scams are a big problem because they play on people&#8217;s feelings and cause them to lose a lot of money. You may guard yourself and your loved ones by being alert, spotting red signals, and using background checks and other resources. Encouragement of scam awareness falls on all of us; by means of proactive actions, we may lower the prevalence of online fraud.</p>

<p>In today’s digital age, businesses face a constant and growing risk of cyber threats. From stolen data to hacking, every organization is vulnerable. However, with the right steps, you can protect your business from cyber threats like corporate investigations and theft. At Lauth Investigations International, we specialize in cyber investigations and workplace investigations to help companies like yours safeguard their operations. Here are three important steps your business can take to defend itself from cyber risks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="300" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cyber-threat.png" alt="hooded man behind computer with face hidden, has hands in front of an unlocked computer screen as if he is hacking into it" class="wp-image-166408" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cyber-threat.png 600w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cyber-threat-480x240.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-implement-strong-cybersecurity-measures"><strong>1. Implement Strong Cybersecurity Measures</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most effective ways to protect your business from cyber threats is by setting up strong cybersecurity systems. Start with the basics—strong passwords, firewalls, and regular software updates. Many cybercriminals exploit weak passwords or outdated systems to access sensitive data. Make sure employees use passwords that are hard to guess and that your network is secured with a strong firewall to keep out unwanted traffic.</p>



<p>Regular software updates are also critical. Hackers often find vulnerabilities in outdated software, so make sure your systems are always up to date. Strong antivirus and anti-malware software should be in place as well, helping prevent cyber threats before they can cause damage.</p>

<p>Many cyber-attacks happen because employees are not aware of the risks. Phishing attacks, where hackers trick employees into clicking on dangerous links or giving up personal information, are a common example. To combat this, employee training is key.</p>



<p>Every company should educate its staff on how to spot suspicious emails and links. Employees should know not to open unexpected attachments or click on unfamiliar links, especially from unknown senders. Regular training sessions will help keep employees alert and aware of the dangers.</p>



<p>Furthermore, your team should be trained on how to report suspicious activity. Early detection is crucial in stopping a cyber threat before it escalates. By making sure everyone understands the risks and knows how to respond, you can prevent many incidents before they cause damage.</p>



<p>Corporate investigations often reveal that employee error is a major factor in data breaches. At Lauth Investigations International, we offer workplace investigations to uncover security gaps and provide solutions to better protect your business.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-conduct-regular-audits-and-investigations"><strong>3</strong><strong>. Conduct Regular Audits and Investigations</strong></h2>



<p>Another important step in defending against cyber threats is conducting regular audits and corporate investigations. These audits can help identify weak points in your security and ensure that your business complies with industry regulations. A regular check-up can help spot issues before they lead to a major security breach.</p>



<p>In addition to audits, cyber investigations can also be used to assess your systems. These investigations focus on detecting suspicious activities, unusual patterns, or any signs of an attack that might have gone unnoticed. By investigating potential threats early on, you can stop an attack before it affects your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today&#8217;s evolving world of business, enhancing the security of an organization is paramount. We are living in an interconnected world, where the entrenchment of technology is one of the single biggest threats for many organizations, and the need for beefing up the internal security of data and assets averts the risk of losing what is considered elemental for an organization. With the lurking threat of cybersecurity, ensuring robust protection measures is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Human resources directors have a responsibility to safeguard the workforce and the integrity of the organization. One effective tool at the disposal of the human resource directors is the security audits. However, merely conducting an audit is not enough; leveraging the outcome fortifies the security of an organization.</p>



<p>Understanding the Essence of Security Audits</p>



<p>It is possible to wake up in a workplace every day and complete the assigned duties without understanding the hidden dangers. Threats are around us in our workplaces, and due to the monotony of our duties, it is possible to overlook a danger that could result in potential losses in the future. Security audit is the systemic evaluation of the organization&#8217;s security posture, <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/security-audit#:~:text=Security%20audits%20will%20help%20protect,and%20can%20catch%20new%20vulnerabilities.">assessing the vulnerabilities, risks, and mitigation measures</a> in place to prevent financial and asset losses. The main benefit of a security audit is to help an organization identify weaknesses and strengthen defense. However, the main advantage of the security audit is not how well it is applied, but how well the outcome is used to improve security. Having the right person to conduct a security audit matters a lot, and we propose Lauth as an appropriate partner to benefit from our wealth of expertise in the field of security audits.</p>



<p>Quantifying the Impact</p>



<p>Data is the most critical asset for any organization, and as technology continues to advance, so do the issues of data protection gaining traction. According to the <a href="https://info.techdata.com/rs/946-OMQ-360/images/Cost_of_a_Data_Breach_Report_2021.PDF">Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021 by IBM Security, the global average cost of a data breach stands at $4.24 million</a>. In the same vein, the same report highlighted that it takes about 287 days to identify and contains issues of data breach, which has financial and reputational repercussions. These numbers underscore the importance of beefing up security, and security audits emerge as a linchpin. As such, Lauth has established itself conducting corporate audits to examine the sustainability of your internal policies in regard to security.</p>



<p>Maximizing Value: A Strategic Approach</p>



<p>In order to benefit from the security audits and witness the needed outcome, organizations must adopt a strategic approach, as detailed below;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Risk identification</em>. Security audit should not be viewed as a compliance process. It has to be taken as an exercise of risk identification and mitigation and de-escalating issues before they become full-blown problems.</li>



<li><em>Actionable insight</em>. Identification of vulnerabilities is not enough. Human resource director should collaborate with the IT team to work on the findings of the security audit and come up with a comprehensive action plan.</li>



<li><em>Investment in training and awareness</em>. Human error is the leading cause of security breaches. Security audit is essential in identifying the gaps in security preparedness in the workplace, thus providing insight into the areas of training and development for the employees.</li>



<li><em>Continuous improvement</em>. Enhancement of security is an ongoing process. Security audits, therefore, are a checkpoint of areas that require improvement and continually update the systems to deal with emerging threats.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Role of Human Resource Director</p>



<p>The human resource department is central to ensuring the safety and security of its workforce and the organization&#8217;s assets. As a rule of thumb, the human resource director should cultivate a culture of security, and this should be made possible by ensuring the workforce adheres to the security protocols. New hires should be involved in a program that trains them on the importance of ensuring their safety and that of the organization to mitigate the loss of finances and productive hours. In that light, a human resource director play a crucial role in security audits in the following ways:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Collaborating with the IT team and other relevant departments to facilitate the completion of the security audit.</li>



<li>Ensuring that the findings of the audits are translated into insights, which are later integrated into the organization&#8217;s policies.</li>



<li>Bolsters employees&#8217; knowledge of cybersecurity by engaging them in training programs.</li>



<li>Allocating resources towards improving security and ensuring continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>In an era plagued by cyber threats, the importance of security audits cannot be overstated. It has become a mandatory tool to assess the threats within an organization and mitigate the risks associated with it. Adopting a strategic approach and findings of the audits positions an organization on a pedestal of overriding the market dynamics and also ensures its assets and workforce are safe. Human resource directors remain the custodians of the organization&#8217;s integrity and, therefore, should champion the cause of security. Embracing the audit&#8217;s security builds trust among the stakeholders, paving the way for sustained success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As we navigate the ever-shifting landscape of security challenges, from cyber threats to physical breaches, one thing is for sure: technology is our trusty sidekick in this high-stakes game of defense. Modern organizations are, therefore, exposed to several threats, but thanks to the advancement of technology. It is now possible to address major security issues using modern technology, which makes it easier to collect information, analyze it, and provide feedback. This output effectively help in making essential decisions, mitigating risks that could stall the operations of a business.</p>



<p>What would it be like if there was no way to make surveillance within the workplace? My guess is as good as yours. The cases of theft, fraud, forgery, violence, and threat, among others, dot the normal day-to-day operations of an organization. This article explores how technology can solve modern challenges, from cybersecurity to surveillance and beyond.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-battling-the-invisible-threats">Battling the Invisible Threats</h2>



<p>The advancement of technology has brought new forms of threats. Cybersecurity is the main challenge that most organizations are battling in our times. The data released by <a href="about:blank">Cybersecurity Ventures</a> indicated that cybercrime was estimated to cost the world about $6 trillion annually by 2021, an increase from $3 trillion in 2015. These numbers are scary because the growth rate shows the potential loss experienced by this vice. It also underscores the urgent need to invest in workable security infrastructure to protect organizations from vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the emerging technologies have offered solutions to the problem. Introducing Artificial Intelligence and machine learning enables proactive threat detection and response. These technologies can analyze data and identify patterns that may indicate cyber-attacks. Regarding the importance of cyber-attacks, we acknowledge the need to beef up technology. Through Lauth&#8217;s services, we shall use the latest surveillance technology to expose unseen factors in your workplace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-physical-security-from-locks-and-keys-to-high-tech-wonders">Physical Security: From Locks and Keys to High-Tech Wonders</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s shift our focus from the digital to the physical world. Remember the days when all that was needed in your office was a sturdy lock and key? Allow me to inform you that those days are gone. Today, we have a whole arsenal of modern technology, which can provide more enhanced security for physical and digital assets, which are the backbones of your organization. Take video surveillance, for example; it is estimated that the global video surveillance market is expected to hit <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/global-video-surveillance-market.asp">$144.85 billion by 2028</a>. The idea here is not having surveillance everywhere, but smart eyes. Thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning-every suspicious activity within the workplace can be flagged, and the security personnel can be informed in real time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacy-concerns-balancing-security-and-civil-liberties">Privacy Concerns: Balancing Security and Civil Liberties</h2>



<p>While we embrace and celebrate advanced technology, we should not hide our heads regarding privacy matters. As an HR director, you have the sole mandate of ensuring that the applied technology does not deny the employees their privacy, as it might attract litigation. The widespread of surveillance cameras, facial recognition, and data analytics tools have raised debates on how these technologies impact individual confidentiality. While the tools effectively ensure security, a proper balance must be achieved. With great power comes great responsibility, as they say.</p>



<p>The main question that comes to mind when we talk of surveillance is how comfortable are workers when they know someone in the office is watching them. According to a study by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">Pew Research Center, about 79%</a> of Americans are concerned about their data being collected by companies and the government. The safety of data and how it&#8217;s managed after that is what concerns them. If the same issue faces your company, we propose you engage Lauth, an intelligence company with well-qualified professionals in different fields. We guarantee that the employees&#8217; intelligence data is well managed, and we shall provide guidelines on strategies to adopt to increase safety while maintaining data integrity.</p>



<p>As we strive to harness the potential of new technologies, it is paramount to strike a balance between security imperatives and respect for privacy. Robust legal frameworks and monitoring must be adhered to ensure that security measures deployed are transparent and do not impede the liberties of workers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The future of technology is now, and it is looking brighter than ever. With the capabilities of technology, we can solve daunting and challenging security issues, from cybersecurity to physical threats and beyond. Remember, it is not about the available technology but how you use it. Lauth defines this phrase very well, and our expertise and use of technology will assist you gather workplace intelligence to enhance security. So, let&#8217;s leverage technology to secure the future, one byte at a time.</p>

<p>eDiscovery, or electronic discovery, is a type of investigation in which information technology is married to private investigation by means of locating digital information both online and offline. The information scraped during these investigations can range from databases to social media profiles, and with more forms of digital data becoming ubiquitous, the need for eDiscovery investigations is only expected to grow. Attorneys are constantly tasked with managing vast volumes of electronically stored information (ESI) during litigation, which can be a daunting and time-consuming process. This is where private investigators can prove to be invaluable allies. </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identifying Relevant Data Sources</li>
</ol>



<p>One of the initial challenges attorneys face in eDiscovery investigations is identifying the pertinent sources of electronic data. Private investigators can help attorneys locate and categorize these sources effectively. By conducting comprehensive investigations and interviews, they can pinpoint potential custodians of relevant information, including witnesses, employees, or third-party entities. This ensures that no stone is left unturned in the search for electronic evidence.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2">
<li>Preserving Evidence in eDiscovery Investigations</li>
</ol>



<p>Preservation is a critical aspect of e-discovery. Private investigators can assist by working with IT professionals to ensure that all potentially relevant ESI is preserved and not altered or deleted. They can help draft legal hold notices, which instruct clients and relevant parties on the obligation to preserve data, thus mitigating the risk of spoliation.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="3">
<li>Forensically Collecting and Analyzing Data</li>
</ol>



<p>Private investigators with expertise in digital forensics can be instrumental in collecting, preserving, and analyzing electronic evidence. They have the skills and tools necessary to extract data from various devices and platforms, ensuring its admissibility in court. This can include recovering deleted files, analyzing metadata, and tracing the digital footprints of individuals or entities involved in the case.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="4">
<li>Data Processing and Review</li>
</ol>



<p>Managing and reviewing large volumes of electronic data can be overwhelming for attorneys. Private investigators can assist in the process by employing e-discovery software to filter, de-duplicate, and organize the data efficiently. They can also create timelines and data visualizations, making it easier for attorneys to understand and present the information in court.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="5">
<li>Social Media and Online Investigations</li>
</ol>



<p>In today&#8217;s digital world, social media and online platforms often hold valuable evidence. Private investigators are adept at conducting discreet online investigations to uncover relevant information, such as social media posts, emails, or communications that may not be readily available through traditional discovery methods.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="6">
<li>Locating and Interviewing Witnesses</li>
</ol>



<p>Private investigators can track down and interview potential witnesses who might possess crucial electronic evidence. They can gather statements, affidavits, or even assist in preparing witnesses for deposition or trial, ensuring that all relevant facts are brought to light.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="7">
<li>Investigating Digital Misconduct</li>
</ol>



<p>When there are allegations of digital misconduct, such as data breaches, hacking, or cyberbullying, private investigators can delve into these matters. Their expertise can help attorneys build a stronger case by understanding the technical aspects of the misconduct and identifying responsible parties.</p>



<p>At the conclusion of all eDiscovery probes, clients receive thorough, detailed reports on their inquiry, along with any expert recommendations regarding the Subject or circumstances of the case. Should the need arise as the result of any subsequent litigation, our analysts and investigators are also available to offer expert testimony regarding what information they observed and catalogued for the client.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="978" height="1024" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/romancescams_58143871-1-978x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-134202"/></figure></div>



<p>How many people do you know who met their significant other online? There&#8217;s probably a few, because tales of whirlwind romances that started virtually are more and more common these days—but sadly, so too are online romance scam stories. Unfortunately, while this particular form of underbelly criminality used to be relegated to niche chatrooms and online dating sites, they are becoming more frequent on social media. Scam artists are using their nefarious talents to sweep targets on Facebook and Instagram off their feet, meaning that just about anyone can become prey to today&#8217;s online dating scam artists. When it comes to avoiding romance scams, knowledge is the first step. </p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t think that a money scammer could get the better of you—or even if you&#8217;re someone who is embarrassed to have been the victim of a scammer before—you might be surprised to know that dating scams are all too common. Staggeringly, last year romance scams <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2022/02/romance-scams-2021-fraudsters-left-you-fakers-right">hit record highs</a>, with victims unwittingly sending some $547 million to perpetrators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the realm of online scams, the human quest for love serves as a tempting target pool. So, don&#8217;t underestimate the importance of knowing the warning signs—and, of course, if you have been a victim, know that you are not alone. We&#8217;ll get into what to do if you&#8217;ve been scammed momentarily, but lets begin first with red flags, and some go-to protective measures.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>What Is the Usual Romance Scam Format?</strong></li></ol>



<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering how to tell if someone is scamming you online. When you meet someone who seems like the one, how can you know if its true love, or true crime? Well, the good news is that once you&#8217;re informed, there are some common red flags that you can keep an eye out for:<br></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The person may say that they are located far away, perhaps out of the country, making it impossible for them to meet you.</li><li>They may push the relationship forward fast, sharing a lot of intimate information about themselves and being quick to say they love you, or even to propose marriage.</li><li>If on an online dating site, they might try to move communication off the site quickly.</li><li>They might repeatedly promise to meet, but always cancel at the last moment.</li><li>Eventually they will begin asking for money, whether it is because of a crisis—like a medical or legal emergency—or for a plane ticket to come see you.</li><li>They may ask for your bank account information under the guise that they will send you money, when they actually intend to use your data to commit fraud.</li></ul>

<p>Both experts and laypersons alike have argued that in utilizing the internet for purposes of automation and convenience, we have sacrificed our security as our personal information floats in the ether. In an age where a great deal of the fraud that occurs in the United States happens in cyberspace, consumers are being cautioned more than ever to steel themselves against the ever-evolving mousetrap of cyber fraud. From our private investigators, here are the best ways consumers <em>and</em> corporations can protect personal information online in 2022.</p>



<p><strong>Strong login credentials</strong></p>



<p>When everything is online—banking, shopping, email, asset protfolios—it can be difficult to remember every username and password, and therefore users may be inclined to use the same username and password for every account. However, experts insist that in order to best protect personal information, users must have a unique username and password for every account and platform where their personal information could be vulnerable to cyber fraud.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Use both upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters like the “@” symbol to strengthen the credentials.</li><li>Do not use personal information as passwords</li><li>Do not store passwords on internet sites where they can be vulnerable to cyber criminals.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Avoid phishing scams</strong></p>



<p>Phishing scams involve using deceptive correspondence, typically an email, in which the sender requests personal information of the target, often masquerading as an official agency such as the IRS. To protect personal information from these phishing scams, users must be vigilant and educated of the signs of phishing scams.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Be wary of images such as logos or color schemes that appear similar to a branded company or agency, but contain differences that the consumer eye may not immediately notice.</li><li>Be wary of any unsolicited communication from a corporation or a federal office.</li><li>Refrain from clicking on any images or hyperlinks in the emails as they could contain malignant viruses that can infect your devices.</li><li>When in doubt, just delete.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Social media scams</strong></p>



<p>Social media connects billions of people in seconds—a feat unlike anything we’ve seen in the history of mankind—but this is also how scammers can connect to their targets on a personal level in the interest of stealing their information.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Scammers can use hidden URLs by virtue of tools that shorten hyperlinks, thereby obscuring the destination. This can lead to malware being surreptitiously downloaded onto your device.</li><li>Other forms of these scams include a bait-and-switch operation in which answering questions to a personality quiz can be used against you to steal your information.</li></ul>



<p>Remember to always keep your anti-malware and anti-spyware protections up to date so that your devices have a first line of defense in preventing cyber fraud. If you have been the victim of cyber fraud, contact Lauth today for a&nbsp; free consultation on how we can help you find the criminals responsible at 317-951-1100, or visit us online at <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com">www.lauthinveststg.wpengine.com</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-pixabay-60504-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-133857" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-pixabay-60504-980x653.jpg 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-pixabay-60504-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber criminals are evolving at an alarming rate. Cyber-security product developers are on an infinite loop with felons, each trying to out fox the other with regards to data breaches. Security is absolutely necessary for brick and mortar establishments due to a myriad of reasons, but in 2019, the name of the game is cyber-security. Not only are data breaches an efficient <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/brand-protection/">way to steal trade secrets</a> and financial information from businesses, but they can also be done remotely. A proficient hacker or scammer can access a company’s vital company information from halfway across the world, and from that same location, can devastate the company. Within minutes, they can access financial information, trade secrets, distribution and delivery schedules, and private customer information. To prevent this from happening to your business, here are 5 cyber security measures every business should have: </span></p>
<p><b>Iron-clad Passwords </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Internet 101. Since the birth of the World Wide Web, we’ve been educating adults and children alike on the importance of having a strong password to access online accounts. Whether it’s a company’s financial information, or a Grubhub app on an executive’s phone, thieves can crack weak passwords to gain access. As such, it’s important passwords never contain personal information about an individual, especially if that information is visible on social media. Parents often include the name of their kids in their passwords, using their dates of birth for any numerical value requirement. Teens and young adults use the name of their favorite animal, sport, or music artist. Another common tactic is using common words that are easy to remember, and then spelling them backwards for a false sense of security. Experts at the National Cyber Security Alliance also do not recommend using sequences of characters that are near each other on the keyboard, such as “QWERTY,” the first six characters of the keyboard. The current recommended length for strong passwords is between 8-12 characters. If you’re unsure whether or not you password is secure, use an online password checker to verify the passwords level of  cyber security. </span></p>
<p><b>Fortified Firewalls </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firewalls have been around almost as long as passwords. Firewalls are shields that protect your business from harmful or insidious traffic. When you connect to the internet, the system is constantly communicating with the wireless network, both sending and receiving units of information known as packets. Firewalls monitor these packets and perform a risk assessment, blocking unsafe packets. These firewalls protect your company’s data from unauthorized remote access by criminals. </span></p>
<p><b>Antivirus Protection </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roland Cloutier, the Chief Security Officer for ADP, calls antivirus software “the last line of defense” when protecting your company’s data from hackers and other cyber-criminals. Not only can remote criminals access and view a company’s vital information, but they can also install vicious malware that will copy the target’s hard drive, and subsequently render the machine inoperable. Installing anti-virus and anti-malware programs aren’t enough, though. These programs need to be updated regularly as part of the infinite loop mentioned earlier. Every time a criminal finds a way to bypass an anti-malware product, the product requires changes to combat those breaches. </span></p>
<p><b>Laptops and Mobile Phones</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/02/sim-card-swapping-scams-leave-businesses-vulnerable/">secure laptop computers and mobile smartphones</a> associated with your business. For this, experts recommend encryption software so any remote felon attempting to access or copy the hard drive cannot do so without the proper password. They also stress the importance of never leaving these devices in ones vehicle, where they are easily accessible to thieves. “Lock-out” options are also standard for these devices in 2019. This setting allows you to establish a time period during which the phone lies idle. After that period expires, the phone locks itself, preventing anyone from accessing it without the password. Smartphones and laptops with remote-wipe features must be enabled. This way, if your device falls into the wrong hands, you can remotely wipe the device and prevent the leak of sensitive company information. </span></p>
<p><b>Employee Education</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last, but never least, it’s important your workforce is educated on the security measures in place and regularly enforces them on a day-to-day basis. Companies often neglect employee education under the false impression their IT team will be able to resolve all issues whenever they arise. The fact is, even IT professionals cannot anticipate every cyber threat, and may not be up-to-date on the very latest in cyber-criminal tactics. An ounce of this education is worth a pound of cure—Despite the level of technology literacy in the United States in 2019, an employer or business owner cannot assume an employee’s level of security knowledge. The prevention starts with employees, providing them with an intimate knowledge of company operations and how cyber security measures protect them. </span></p>
<p>Regardless of your company&#8217;s industry or size, all businesses must update and maintain their cyber security. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when criminals can bypass cyber security, and devastate a company in minutes.</p><p>The post <a href="https://lauthinvestigations.com/5-cyber-security-measures-every-business/">5 Cyber Security Measures Every Business Needs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://lauthinvestigations.com">Indiana Private Investigators | Lauth Investigations International, Inc.</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1721" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/money-locked.png" alt="money locked" width="724" height="436" />The invention of direct-deposit payments in electronic banking have likely saved companies millions of dollars over the years in labor hours, materials, and fees that previously caused problems for companies. However, in an age where your paycheck is sent automatically to your checking account, phishers are seeking to exploit this automation for personal gain.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service has reported an upswing in various types of fraud that directly target a company’s payroll. While the ruses come in many forms, one of the most popular is phishing emails disguised as legitimate correspondence from an employee or upper management. It’s always an instruction to alter payroll information so that funds would be rerouted to the scammer’s bank account. Once the deed is done, the money is withdrawn and the company is responsible to replace the missing funds. While the FTC and the IRS are constantly reevaluating their strategies for containing these types of fraud, this particular scheme is hard to detect and often goes unreported. The email can outsmart security measures set down by the company or within a company’s email server, and scammers take amounts that can just be written off as unfortunate missteps on behalf of personnel.</p>
<p>Frauds such as these have gone through an evolution as security technology becomes more sophisticated and what we know about internet culture continues to grow. Internet frauds used to be about volume and inattention to detail—thus the birth of phishers, who sent emails rife with spelling and grammar mistakes out to mile-long email lists, casting a wide net throughout the web. Education about fraud has forced scammers to be more cautious. Today, companies who have seen this scam in its newest form remark that these phishing emails look so authentic that there may not be a question in their mind before obliging their request. Security measures that have risen from the nucleus of electronic banking combat wire fraud every day in the United States. Large sums in wire transfers now throw up giant red flags. Phishers and scammers are getting more bang for their buck by taking smaller amounts with more frequency, lurking below the radar. This does not require sophisticated hacking skills. Just the ability to open a Gmail account. Phishers make the account look cosmetically convincing, then throw out the lure. One of the most targeted entities is non-profit organizations, because of the benevolent nature of their business. The idea of someone ripping off a charity or relief organization is horrifying, but the simplicity of scams like this make the opportunity too lucrative to pass up.</p>
<p>It’s frightening how simple the fraud is to pull off, but there is recourse for businesses who are vulnerable to such a scam. One of the non-profits who fell prey to this scam was KVC Health Systems, an agency for child welfare in Kansas City. Their IT director, Erik Nyberg, says it starts with comprehensive education on company procedures, “The CEO is never going to email you out of the blue and ask you for any deposit changes. And if you have any sliver of a doubt, call the person who is making the request.” He goes on to discourage executives and upper management employees from using their personal email accounts to send staff correspondence, and to set email filters that will catch suspicious incoming messages. Social media managers are also cautioned against posting any company information to their pages that could serve to bolster a phisher’s credibility.</p>
<p>If your business has been the target of this wire fraud scam, you are encouraged to report them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx">IC3 tip line</a>.</p>
