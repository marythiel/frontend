										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today&#8217;s world, companies face many risks. One of the biggest risks comes from within the company itself. These are called insider threats, and&nbsp; when employees or other trusted people inside a company do things that harm the business. These actions can be stealing secrets, damaging property, or even leaking important information. This blog will explain how companies can use corporate investigations to protect themselves from insider threats.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-insider-threats"><strong>What Are Insider Threats?</strong></h2>



<p>Insider threats are actions taken by people inside a company that can harm the business. These people can be employees, contractors, or even business partners. Sometimes, they do these harmful things on purpose. Other times, they do it by accident, but the results can be just as damaging.</p>



<p>For example, a worker might accidentally share a company’s secret information with the wrong person. In another case, an employee might purposely steal customer data to sell it to someone else. Both of these are insider threats, even though one was an accident and the other was on purpose.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-insider-threats-dangerous"><strong>Why Are Insider Threats Dangerous?</strong></h2>



<p>Insider threats are dangerous because the people inside a company already have access to important information. They know the company’s secrets, systems, and weaknesses. Because of this, they can cause more harm than someone from the outside.</p>



<p>Imagine if a worker who knows all the passwords to the company’s computer system decided to share them with someone else. This could allow a hacker to get into the company’s system and steal important data. Because the worker had inside access, the hacker&#8217;s job becomes much easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-types-of-insider-threats"><strong>Common Types of Insider Threats</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdz7qtZDbQjoHvdJnDzpXcIKWBYWWgQ5sPPR05cl2wd2bz_vgxfSesLGmZIXKlA-vQBcu5YEopQP1lC1UAXuHgtaBPtd8uELUqG1QsxtsAI8Ac6fO-ovFEOmJzYqXd9PrFoUjVK8DBXElwzzaBxkOMt6kNTmtEr4yI46uL_DrXcW0MoG27TSw?key=gW9ZBATFPoJlwf51PL2wSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>There are different types of insider threats, and it&#8217;s important to understand each one so companies can protect themselves.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Malicious Insiders</strong>: These are people who intentionally want to harm the company. They might be upset with their job, want revenge, or want to make money by selling company secrets. These insiders are very dangerous because they know the company well and can plan their attacks carefully.</li>



<li><strong>Careless Insiders</strong>: Sometimes, insiders do not mean to cause harm, but they do so by being careless. For example, an employee might accidentally click on a phishing email that gives hackers access to the company&#8217;s data. Even though the employee did not mean to do harm, the results can be just as bad as if they did.</li>



<li><strong>Third-Party Insiders</strong>: These are people who work with the company but are not direct employees. For example, a contractor might have access to the company’s systems and accidentally leak important information. Because they are not full-time employees, they might not follow the same security rules, making them a potential threat.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-corporate-investigations-help"><strong>How Corporate Investigations Help?</strong></h2>



<p>Corporate investigations are a way for companies to protect themselves from insider threats. These investigations involve looking closely at what is happening inside the company to find any problems or risks.</p>



<p>Investigators might look at things like emails, computer files, and even security camera footage. They do this to find out if anyone is doing something that could harm the company. If they find a problem, they can work to fix it before it gets worse.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steps-in-a-corporate-investigation"><strong>Steps in a Corporate Investigation</strong></h2>



<p>There are several steps involved in a corporate investigation. These steps help ensure that the investigation is thorough and finds any potential insider threats.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Identifying the Problem</strong>: The first step is to figure out what the problem is. This could be a missing file, strange behavior from an employee, or a security breach. Identifying the problem early is important because it allows the investigation to focus on the right areas.</li>



<li><strong>Gathering Evidence</strong>: After identifying the problem, the next step is to gather evidence. This could include looking at emails, checking computer logs, and interviewing employees. The goal is to find proof of what is happening so that the company can take action.</li>



<li><strong>Analyzing the Evidence</strong>: Once the evidence is gathered, it needs to be analyzed. This means looking closely at the data to find patterns or signs of wrongdoing. For example, if an employee is sending a lot of emails to a competitor, this could be a sign that they are leaking information.</li>



<li><strong>Taking Action</strong>: After the evidence has been analyzed, the company can take action. This might mean firing an employee, changing security protocols, or even involving law enforcement if the situation is serious. The goal is to stop the insider threat before it can cause more harm.</li>



<li><strong>Preventing Future Threats</strong>: The final step is to put measures in place to prevent future insider threats. This could include better training for employees, stronger security systems, or regular checks to ensure everything is running smoothly.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-role-of-technology-in-corporate-investigations"><strong>The Role of Technology in Corporate Investigations</strong></h2>



<p>Technology plays a big role in corporate investigations. With the help of advanced tools, companies can monitor their systems more closely and detect insider threats more quickly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfnDlAXjyYGt80JhqBLMSOODlFsOpk26iLyOhWedmx0Fc0pQ0i3GA-bEgYHyz6I1Drj2DdDGD3c-lozqX1TSmiWgZ5OKaIompra7WB--2QZXZrLuu0Fs0BmiK956TRwyUi3BjqfZ15L4ZXQUpLMLbAqQQhqwF4EKPngC-Dnp7dtWnr_kSl3Rw?key=gW9ZBATFPoJlwf51PL2wSg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>For example, many companies use software that can track employee activity on company computers. This software can alert the company if an employee is doing something suspicious, like trying to access files they shouldn’t. This early warning system can help prevent insider threats before they cause any damage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-case-studies-real-life-examples-of-insider-threats"><strong>Case Studies: Real-Life Examples of Insider Threats</strong></h2>



<p>To understand how serious insider threats can be, let&#8217;s look at some real-life examples.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The Edward Snowden Case</strong>: Edward Snowden was a contractor for the U.S. government who leaked classified information. He had access to important files and used that access to share secrets with the public. This case shows how dangerous insider threats can be when someone with inside knowledge decides to act against the organization.</li>



<li><strong>The Coca-Cola Recipe Theft Attempt</strong>: In 2006, an employee at Coca-Cola tried to steal the secret recipe for Coca-Cola and sell it to Pepsi. Pepsi reported the attempt to Coca-Cola, and the employee was caught. This case highlights how insider threats can be driven by greed and how they can be stopped with the right measures in place.</li>



<li><strong>Target Data Breach</strong>: In 2013, hackers stole credit card information from millions of Target customers. The hackers gained access to Target’s systems through a third-party contractor. This case shows how third-party insiders can pose a threat, even if they do not work directly for the company.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-best-practices-for-preventing-insider-threats"><strong>Best Practices for Preventing Insider Threats</strong></h2>



<p>Preventing insider threats requires a proactive approach. Here are some best practices that companies can follow to protect themselves:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Conduct Regular Employee Training</strong>: Employees should be trained on how to recognize and avoid insider threats. This includes being aware of phishing emails, securing their workstations, and following company security policies.</li>



<li><strong>Implement Strong Access Controls</strong>: Not everyone in the company needs access to all information. By limiting access to only those who need it, companies can reduce the risk of insider threats.</li>



<li><strong>Monitor Employee Activity</strong>: Regularly monitoring employee activity can help catch suspicious behavior early. This could include checking email usage, reviewing access logs, and keeping an eye on file transfers.</li>



<li><strong>Use Technology Wisely</strong>: Implementing the right technology can help companies detect and prevent insider threats. This could include security software, encryption tools, and regular system audits.</li>



<li><strong>Foster a Positive Work Environment</strong>: A happy and engaged workforce is less likely to become a source of insider threats. Companies should work to create a positive work environment where employees feel valued and heard.</li>
</ol>



<p>Insider threats are a serious risk for any company. Because these threats come from within, they can be more difficult to detect and prevent. However, with the right strategies, including corporate investigations, companies can protect themselves. By being proactive, using technology, and following best practices, businesses can reduce the risk of insider threats and keep their operations safe.If you suspect an insider threat or need help with a corporate investigation, contact <a href="hirelauth@lauthinvestigations.com">Lauth Investigations International today</a>.</p>

<p>Financial fraud – two words that strike fear into the hearts of individuals and businesses alike. In today&#8217;s world, where digital transactions and complex financial systems reign supreme, the risk of falling victim to fraudulent activities is higher than ever. From identity theft and credit card fraud to elaborate Ponzi schemes and insider trading, the tactics employed by fraudsters are as diverse as they are deceptive. But fear not, for in this article, we will delve deep into the realm of <a href="https://lauthinvestigations.com/fraud-forgery/">financial fraud</a> prevention, exploring strategies that individuals and businesses can implement to safeguard their assets and mitigate risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Landscape of Financial Fraud</h2>



<p>Before we dive into prevention strategies, let&#8217;s take a moment to understand the landscape of financial fraud. In recent years, the prevalence of cyber crime has skyrocketed, with hackers and scammers employing sophisticated tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in digital systems. Phishing emails, malware attacks, and data breaches are just a few examples of the techniques used by cyber criminals to gain access to sensitive information and perpetrate fraud.</p>



<p>In addition to cyber crime, traditional forms of fraud such as identity theft and embezzlement continue to pose significant threats to individuals and businesses. Whether it&#8217;s a dishonest employee skimming funds from company accounts or a fraudster using stolen personal information to open fraudulent credit accounts, the impact of financial fraud can be devastating, both financially and emotionally.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Strategies for Individuals</h2>



<p>Now that we have a better understanding of the risks associated with financial fraud, let&#8217;s explore some strategies that individuals can employ to protect themselves against falling victim to fraudulent activities.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Monitor Financial Accounts Regularly</strong>: One of the most effective ways to detect and prevent fraud is to monitor your financial accounts regularly. Keep a close eye on your bank statements, credit card transactions, and credit reports for any suspicious activity. If you notice any unauthorized charges or unfamiliar accounts, report them to your financial institution immediately.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Use Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication</strong>: Protect your online accounts by using strong, unique passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it more difficult for fraudsters to gain access to your accounts.</li>



<li><strong>Be Wary of Phishing Attempts</strong>: Phishing emails are a common tactic used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or financial details. Be cautious of unsolicited emails or messages asking for personal information, and never click on links or download attachments from unknown senders.</li>



<li><strong>Shred Sensitive Documents</strong>: Dispose of sensitive documents such as bank statements, credit card bills, and tax forms securely by shredding them before throwing them away. This helps prevent identity thieves from rummaging through your trash and stealing your personal information.</li>



<li><strong>Stay Informed</strong>: Educate yourself about the latest scams and fraud trends so that you can recognize potential threats and take appropriate action to protect yourself. Stay up-to-date on news and information from reputable sources, and don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to your financial institution or law enforcement if you suspect fraudulent activity.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Strategies for Businesses</h2>



<p>In addition to individuals, businesses also face significant risks when it comes to financial fraud. From employee theft and vendor fraud to sophisticated cyberattacks, the potential for loss is substantial. Here are some strategies that businesses can implement to prevent financial fraud:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;<strong>Implement Strong Internal Controls</strong>: Establish robust internal controls and procedures to safeguard your company&#8217;s assets and detect fraudulent activity. This may include segregation of duties, regular audits, and strict approval processes for financial transactions.</li>



<li><strong>Conduct Background Checks</strong>: Before hiring new employees or engaging with vendors and contractors, conduct thorough background checks to verify their credentials and ensure they have a clean record. This can help prevent hiring individuals with a history of fraud or dishonesty.</li>



<li><strong>Provide Ongoing Training</strong>: Educate your employees about the risks of financial fraud and provide training on how to recognize and report suspicious activity. Encourage a culture of transparency and accountability, where employees feel comfortable speaking up if they suspect fraudulent behavior.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Secure Your Digital Systems</strong>: Invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect your company&#8217;s sensitive information from cyberattacks. This may include firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and regular security updates.</li>



<li><strong>Monitor Financial Transactions</strong>: Keep a close eye on your company&#8217;s financial transactions and accounts, and regularly reconcile accounts to detect any discrepancies or irregularities. Implement automated monitoring systems to flag suspicious activity in real-time.</li>
</ul>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States government has been shut down for almost four weeks, sending shockwaves throughout a nation already gripped by tumultuous politics and controversial issues. In addition to institutions like the National Parks System, and the National Institute of Health, all federal employees have currently been laid off from duty, and a majority of their services suspended. The ripple effect is dizzying, with many of the governments services being on hold for the duration of the shutdown. Many consumers across the country are not aware of the shutdown’s impact on some of our nation’s best departments, so you can imagine their shock when they phoned to report a consumer complaint, and were told the government couldn’t help them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When running normally, the government requires a wealth of quality communication to run smoothly. As many federal employees remain on furlough, therefore not being compensated, everyone’s level of communication with one another is atypical and—as many federal employees are called in without pay—constantly breaking down. </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CFPB) is the federal agency that fields the influx of consumer complaints. A consumer submits their complaint about a business or financial entity to the CFPB, which is reviewed. According to the CFPB, after the complaint is reviewed, “We’ll forward your complaint and any documents you provide to the company and work to get a response from them. If we find that another government agency would be better able to assist, we will forward your complaint to them and let you know.” The CFPB </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-cfpb-complaint-database-20180608-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remains in operation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was not effected by the shutdown, but if the agency is ill-equipped to deal with the complaint, they may never get off the ground, as the appropriate department might be effected by the shutdown. This leaves many consumers displaced when it comes to voicing their concerns about products and services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1705" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/la-fi-lazarus-fcc-robocalls-20160729-snap-1024x576.jpg" alt="la-fi-lazarus-fcc-robocalls-20160729-snap" width="1024" height="576" />This suspension of protection services has allowed the beast of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/01/11/latest-threat-government-shutdown-more-robocalls/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b87b54cdf358"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robo-calls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fester and become feral, as consumers cannot block or report harassing robo-calls. They’re left screaming into the void. Alex Quilici, the chief executive of YouMail—a smartphone application that helps consumers block robo-calls—describes it, “It’s a neighborhood with no police on the beat.” YouMail estimated, just last month, there were 5 billion robo-calls made, and 50% of calls made in early 2019 could be coming from scammers and robots attempting to fraudulently obtain your information. These horrifying statistics are the codas for a chorus of federal employees who are aware of the scope of the problem, like Jessica Rosenworcel, the Federal Communications Commission Commissioner, “The number of robo-calls consumers are receiving is insane. The problem just keeps growing. Shutting down the government is not going to help.” As of this moment, there is no one to administrate the “Do Not Call” list, the national registry in which consumers can ask specific companies not to contact them. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.acainternational.org/news/online-services-for-consumers-and-business-impacted-by-government-shutdown"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Communications Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just one of many threads woven into the Federal Trade Commission. Another voiceless victim of the shutdown is the victim of identity fraud. Louette Duvall is one of these victims. Not long after the holidays were over, Duvall’s car was pilfered by thieves while she was at her job. They made off with her purse, her briefcase, and a wealth of identifying information that amounted to a scammer’s treasure trove. Fraudulent charges started rolling in as she scrambled to alert all of her creditors and financial institutions that she had been robbed. She began calculating the full scope of </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shutdown-blocks-help-identity-theft-victims-ftc-goes-dark-n957721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the theft’s ramifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: New checkbooks ordered, extravagant items ordered in her name, new credit cards, the list goes on and on. When she called the Federal Trade Commission to let them know her identity had been stolen, she was told they could not help her due to the government shutdown. FTC data prior to the shutdown stated that the agency received thousands of calls a day regarding identity theft alone. That’s thousands of crimes going uninvestigated every day, a Washington Post reporter pointed out when they became a victim as well. Not only are new crimes going unreported, but investigative resources are also frozen. The Consumer Sentinel Network helps investigators track the movement of identity theft and related frauds to build cases against the perpetrators, and it remains down as of day 26 of the longest government shutdown in history. At a minimum, the FTC is still allowing individuals to file complaints so that they be issued an affidavit for their creditors’ purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News coverage of the shutdown has attempted to sharpen the big picture for Americans when it comes to the ripple effect of the government shutdown. While many federal agencies might be </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/15/shutdown-impact-inspection-finance-investigation-1079014"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to assist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consumers with complaints, there is recourse for consumers experiencing the myriad of issues helmed by the Federal Trade Commission. There are online, step-by-step resources for obtaining documentation to dispute fraudulent charges and claims. Consumers can also retain the services of a private investigator. One of the most beneficial aspects of hiring a private investigator is that they are the top of the chain of command in their firm. They are the ones calling the shots in any investigation, not a supervisor nor a superior. They will represent your interests and your interests alone. As is the case with many frauds and thefts, perpetrators tend to either operate remotely, or move quickly to evade law enforcement. Acting independently, private investigators will be able to move as fluidly as a scammer, crossing jurisdictional boundaries with little to no red tape. Statistics surrounding fraud indicate that many federal investigators in charge of tracking down scammers and thieves are inundated with a never-ending stream of complaints. This means their attention can be divided over and over again across a heavy caseload. A typical private investigator only handles between 3-4 cases at a time, meaning your case can be a priority for them and not just another file in a drawer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political pundits and talking heads don’t project a sunny forecast when it comes to the shutdown—no end in sight. As the shutdown enters its 27</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> day, many Americans who have been the victims of consumer fraud and identity theft who do not yet know the full scope of the shutdown’s impact will receive an ugly surprise when they turn to the federal government for help. While the government gets its house in order, know that there are options for victims of consumer and identity fraud. Consult a private investigator today to learn how their specific skill set, experience, and independence can help you get right the ship when it comes to fraud. </span></p></div>
