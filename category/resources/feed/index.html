<p>Picture this: a workplace where employees feel respected, safe, and valued. Sounds good, right! Unfortunately, this is not always an ideal situation. The study by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revealed that workplace violence affects about 2 million people every year in the United States alone. These figures may be scary and mitigate your determination to conduct business. Fear not, as there are well-proven strategies that you can implement to safeguard your employees and organization. This article will discuss five effective methods to create a working environment where safety reigns supreme.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Comprehensive Prevention Policy</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine a castle without robust walls; it will be prone to attacks. Similarly, the organization and employees are at risk without a workable prevention policy in the workplace. Policies are internally created and customized to fit the nature of your business. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all policies, as different organizations engage in activities with varied levels of risk. Studies have shown that workplaces with clear violence policies report lower incidences. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine indicates that companies with violence policies experience 40% fewer cases than those without such guidelines.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The policy should define terms such as harassment, verbal abuse, and physical violence, which employees experience in the workplace. Notably, this policy document should also clearly indicate the reporting procedure, the disciplinary action to be taken, and the supportive mechanism for the victims. While some human resource directors might consider this a lot of work, it improves productivity. We, as Lauth, will conduct a proper violence assessment to give you insight into how well-prepared you are for incidences of violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Training and Creating Awareness among the Employees</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is self-fulfilling for a business owner to have a vigilant team that can detect threats. Employee training equips them with the necessary skills, such as interpersonal skills and conflict management, which makes them handle issues that could result in violence. The leading cause of violence within the workplace is a lack of understanding among the workforce, and appreciating diversity lessens violence. Investing in training saves time that could have been used to solve the conflict. For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) study showed that companies that invested in workplace violence training experienced a 70% reduction in workplace violence. Arm your team with knowledge!</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting Rigorous Risk Assessment</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps you cannot perceive the inherent risk that violence can bring to your business because it has never happened. Or better put, take into consideration an employee who gets injured while at work due to an incidence of violence, such as a physical altercation. Picture that regarding litigations related to work injury benefit claims, and I am sure you will appreciate the need to fortify your defense. A regular risk assessment identifies the vulnerabilities within your business. Through our experienced risk assessment investigator, we identify weak points in your system and provide a comprehensive report on improvements.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing Workplace Violence Prevention Teams</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Having a dedicated team of guardians for preventing workplace violence is the best thing you can gift your business this year. This team is instrumental in ensuring petty issues resulting from violence are handled out immediately before they escalate. A small problem, such as miscommunication, can snowball into physical or verbal abuse. It is prudent to establish a workplace violence prevention team consisting of experts from different departments, and their primary role would be to develop and implement violence prevention strategies.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:image {"id":165943,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="545" height="558" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2.png" alt="Proactive Strategies for Preventing Workplace Violence" class="wp-image-165943" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2.png 545w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2-480x491.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 545px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Organizations with a workable workplace violence prevention team are good at establishing potential threats before they happen. This is supported by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), which indicated that 80% of the companies with violence prevention teams reported a decrease in workplace violence incidences. As a starting point, develop a violence prevention team and track the cases within the first year. The outcome will be appealing, and for you to achieve this, we suggest helping you with a corporate culture audit to serve as a mirror of exactly how prepared you are in regard to workplace violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting a Culture of Respect and Support</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Build solidarity among your employees. Being united is a compact pillar in mitigating violence in the workplace. Successful organizations foster a culture of respect and support, which essentially prevents violence in the workforce. This is because the employees feel valued, and they tend to propagate the value of respect to the advantage of the business. How do you cultivate a culture of support and respect? This happens through encouraging open communication and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination. These approaches create a sense of belonging, preventing conflict from escalating into violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is undeniably true that workplace violence impedes an organization&#8217;s growth and lowers productivity. As the workforce continues to become more diverse, the chances of conflicts, hence violence, would continue in the workplace. Therefore, it is wrong to sit and wait until an incident happens in order to act. This article has highlighted the different strategies you can adopt for your enterprise and stand out in averting the repercussions that tag along with violence. Lauth can help you with your violence assessment, risk assessment, and corporate audit to mitigate violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When someone owes you money, no one ever said they had to make it easy to collect. Debtors have been developing new ways to dodge their debts for as long as anyone can remember. In turn, <a href="https://www.pinow.com/investigations/judgment-recovery">collectors across all industries </a>have had to develop methods of collection to prevent people from hiding an asset.  One of a collector’s greatest assets in this modern age<a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/04/dont-wait-hire-private-investigator/"> is an independent private investigator</a>. While collectors deal with the paperwork, private investigators do the legwork, using proven methodology to unearth the hidden assets of debtors in arears. </p>



<p>Private investigators work with some of the same tools and
the same methodology as law enforcement when looking for debtor assets. As part
of their licensure, private investigators have access to verified databases
that allow them to develop comprehensive, cross-referenced background profiles
on a Subject in any investigation. Private investigators have diverse
experience in analyzing a person’s criminal, financial, address, and litigation
history in order to build a contextualized picture of a debtor’s circumstances.
Private investigators can unearth unseen assets like property, financial
accounts, vehicles, and other valuable assets that have been previously
concealed. Human sources are less common in asset searches, but private
investigators also have the training to build rapport and garner testimony from
relevant human sources in the case.&nbsp; Private
investigators are also highly skilled in obtaining and reviewing litigation
records to document a debtor’s history of litigation in a court of law. Pervasive
lawsuits, especially involving large judgements, can be a red flag in an asset
search investigation. </p>



<p>Social media has become a more valuable resource than ever
in many types of investigations. The amount of information people unwittingly
give away on social media is staggering. Private investigators can get
information about the sale of personal belongings, photos of assets like
property and vehicles, and can document the type of lifestyle a debtor is
currently enjoying—like lavish vacations or expensive home renovations. Private
investigators carefully document their findings to compile into a thorough
report for the client as another building block in their case against the
debtor in arears. </p>



<p>If you’re a collecting party trying to reap your due, don’t
hesitate to reach out to private investigator for a quote on their asset search
services. Through open-source intelligence and transparent investigation
methods, private investigators can get to the bottom of a debtors hidden
assets. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/backgroundcheck_44459240.png" alt="Background Check to Protect Your Assets in Marriage" class="wp-image-2285"/><figcaption>When you&#8217;re considering marriage, you should also considering running a background check on your partner to protect your assets. </figcaption></figure>



<p> Even if you didn’t meet your significant other in cyberspace, you could still be at risk for con artists and scammers. That’s why more individuals are turning to <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/06/background-checks-for-nonprofit-board-members/">private investigators to perform background checks</a> on their potential life mates. </p>



<p>One of the most critical decisions we make in life is who to legally bind ourselves to in matrimony—not only because of the vows we make to each other, but also because the legal union in most states means entitling the other person to half of your assets. There is an unexpected trend of private investigators—<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/23/indian-ladies-detective-agencies-cheating-social-media">especially female private investigators</a>—in countries where arranged marriage is woven into the fabric of culture. Many families seek to control familial relations and extensions for many reasons, like politics, financials, business consolidation, and status. As recently as 2017, arranged marriage accounted for 55% of marriages throughout the globe, leaving traditional marriage in the minority. This creates a niche market for private investigators to properly vet potential spouses in countries like India, China, Pakistan, Japan, and Israel to name a few. </p>



<p>Even though arranged marriage is not a major part of Western
culture, that doesn’t mean that engaged individuals in the United States
shouldn’t do their due-diligence when it comes to their life mate. When it
comes to your assets, you should expect facts, not fiction. That’s why hiring a
private investigator to perform a background check on your intended can save a
great deal of heartache and financial distress. Even a basic background check
from a private investigator can unearth risk factors. Private investigators
will pull criminal history, litigation history, credit history, and history of
residence to corroborate proposed facts about your romantic partner. It’s true
that there are many “people finder” databases on the internet that claim their
results are accurate and worth the cost of purchasing the report, and therefore
an individual could conduct a background check themselves. However, private
investigators must comply with specific security protocol and licensing in
order to have access to verified databases on par with certain law enforcement
agencies. This means that the quality of data entry comes with a much higher
degree of accuracy, and will be updated regularly with regards to both public
and private records. “People finder” databases cannot guarantee 100% accuracy, which
may lead to additional misinformation, especially with regards to criminal and
litigation history. </p>



<p>Private investigators also have years of experience that contextualize
available information on a subject. For example, residence history is
traditionally part of a basic background check. If the subject has a long
history of moving between jurisdictions, or from state-to-state in short
periods of time, a private investigator might examine this information—and based
on context—determine that the subject has a history of transience, which could
indicate a lack of reliability or a flight risk. If a subject’s credit history
is consistently poor, that would be a financial red flag that might disqualify
a subject as a spouse. </p>



<p>Private investigators bring valuable contexts to background
investigations that empower individuals to make critical decisions in their private
or corporate life. When two people get married, they often conduct other litmus
tests in order to determine long-term cohabitation, such as blood tests for
their health, or pre-marital counseling to determine their level of preparation.
Background checks are just another measure for you to ensure that your life and
your livelihood are protected. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Virginia legislation placed on notice following the active shooter event in Virginia Beach. </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5cf2e8aa07279.image_-1024x565.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2135"/><figcaption>Victims of the Virginia Beach shooting.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In what has seemed like a death from a thousand cuts, the mass active shooter event that occurred on Friday, May 28<sup>th</sup> at a municipal building in Virginia Beach has inspired action on the part of state leadership. According to<em> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/04/virginia-beach-shooting-gov-northam-calls-special-session-guns/1337559001/">USA Today</a></em>, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has ordered a legislative session devoted to exploring the current climate of gun violence in the United states. At a news conference, Northam said, “The nation is watching. We must do more than our thoughts and prayers. We must give Virginians the action they deserve.” </p>



<p>It was a public works employee who killed 12 people last week—another senseless tragedy in a long line of mass shootings that have spiked in recent years. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, shootings accounted for 79% of all workplace homicides in 2016. Statistics from the Office of Victims of Violent Crime indicate this number has not only risen dramatically but will continue to rise. The number of mass shootings was nearly 2.5 times greater over the last ten years—greater than the mass shootings that occurred between 1998 and 2007. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/states-stats-active-shooter.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2136"/><figcaption>This infographic displays the number of active shooter events in each state in 2018, per 1 million individuals. </figcaption></figure>



<p>While the governor of Virginia has put the legislation on notice, <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2018/11/active-shooter-training-workplace/">businesses throughout the nation</a> have put themselves on notice as well, with interest in active shooter training programs for businesses increasing exponentially with each new report of gun violence in the workplace. What’s chilling is OSHA estimates 25% of workplace violence goes unreported.  Yet, many businesses believe events like the ones that transpired in Virginia Beach cannot happen to them.</p>



<p>Many businesses not only believe an active shooter event is unlikely, but that they are, in fact, prepared for one. If you happen to be reading this at your desk, or on a break at your job, do you know the evacuation protocol for your business in the event of an active shooter? Evacuation procedures like these are often explained in personnel materials like handbooks and manuals. But the average employee is not regularly engaged on the topic, let alone received comprehensive education &amp; demonstration of these protocols. It is a morbid, serious subject, and it is not uncommon for management or leadership in a business/organization to be uncomfortable with addressing it, and certainly struggle with addressing it comprehensively. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/graphic-5-location-categories2017-1024x599.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2137"/><figcaption>This downloadable graphic reflects statistical information pertaining to the 220 FBI-designated active shooter incidents that occurred in the United States between 2000-2016. This graphic depicts incidents broken down by location category.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Companies who have decided that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure are investing in contracts with independent investigators to perform risk assessments on their headquarters and locations of business. These investigators consider factors such as the total volume of personnel, layout of the worksite, and security protocol to determine what is needed to keep the employees safe and secure. </p>



<p>These horrific crimes are also placing a heavy financial burden on businesses. Lower &amp; Associates estimates businesses across the United States will lose more than $55 million in employee wages each year due to violence in the workplace. They experience direct losses in the form of medical expenses, workers’ compensation, litigation fees, and indirect losses such as breakdown in operations due to arrested productivity, record-low morale, and public relation nightmares. Not to mention the fact that a business’s preparedness for an active shooter event is literally a matter of life and death. </p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a corporate crisis? While exact definitions may differ, a corporate crisis is generally defined as “an event, situation, or public initiative that threatens the company&#8217;s ability to effectively operate its business. A crisis can escalate into a disaster or long-term impediment to business growth if not handled with efficiency and sensitivity to all involved.” This is a large umbrella that encompasses many of the internal issues we associate with companies, including (but not limited to) fraud, theft, misconduct, and harassment of all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of corporate crises fall into one of three categories: personnel, systemic, and contextual. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <strong>personnel crisis</strong> is an internal issue that is a direct result of an individual employee or a group of employees’ bad behavior. Theft by personnel is one of the most widely-reported crises in corporations throughout America. The scope of this problem can be as small as stealing office supplies all the way up to executive embezzlement. Sexual harassment is a type of personnel crisis receiving a welcomed new level of attention in corporations. In the age of the #MeToo movement, corporations are viewing their workforce very differently when it comes to <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2018/10/investigating-employee-misconduct/">identifying potential predators</a> in their midst in the name of a “pound of cure.” Prudent steps taken when vetting potential hires and current employees has saved companies difficulties down the line, especially in legal fees and public relations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
<li>A <strong>systemic crisis</strong> refers to a major breakdown in operations negatively impacting business. A common example is food service corporations that receive a sudden influx of food poisoning complaints. Source of the outbreak may be traced back to how the supplier or distributor handled the food product, and suddenly, there’s a systemic crisis: A misstep in operations led to a large sum of incidents. Systemic problems manifest themselves in many forms, including <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/01/line-exposing-theft-manufacturing/">external theft</a>. Repeated theft, both in <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2014/09/private-investigation-celebrity-cyber-hackers/">cyberspace </a>and the real world, is often the result of insufficient security within a company. Consequently, the company incurs loss because they remain vulnerable. Companies who have chronic turnover due to employee misconduct may have flaws in their vetting system for potential employees. That is another example of a crucial operation where a breakdown occurs and erodes a company’s profits with labor hours to hire a new individual to fill a vacant position.</li>
<li>A <strong>contextual crisis</strong> has exponential consequences for a business relative to its size. These are the types of crises that companies cannot anticipate, because they influence public perception of their brand based on real-life events. A major news story like a mass shooting, or a major criminal case, or a lawsuit, can negatively impact a brand even if that event is not directly associated with that company. These external events can drastically change a company’s internal operations, and can weigh heavy on employees at every level. <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/02/private-investigators-sexual-abuse-investigations/">Sexual harassment</a> is another example of this type of crisis in motion. The media coverage regarding high-level Hollywood executives like Harvey Weinstein and his alleged history of abuse have executives in companies of all shapes and sizes revisiting their human resource policies and practices when it comes to addressing sexual misconduct in the workplace. Internal operations receive a major overhaul to the benefit of a healthier work environment for everyone.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to corporate crises, not all businesses will be able to afford specialized investigators to work in-house to resolve issues that arise. Even if they can afford these professionals, investigators employed by the company—regardless of the quality of their work—by definition cannot provide a truly objective solution to any problem. Because they’re employed by the corporation, they have a potential stake in the outcome of the investigation, whether that stake be real or perceived. Hiring an independent professional, <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2018/07/5-ways-private-investigators-benefit-human-resources/">like a licensed private investigator</a>, to conduct an external investigation is the best way to ensure that the solution is objective. This is particularly important personnel crises, because terminating personnel based on an unbiased investigation is kerosene for a disgruntled employee that can manifest itself with many devastating consequences—most commonly wrongful termination lawsuits. Private investigators can assist in systemic crises as well, like the example of repeated thefts with regards to security. Private investigators who specialize in different kinds of risk assessment can identify a company’s vulnerabilities to thieves and scammers, and provide them with a game plan to improve their security. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2051" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/consumerfraud_37267224.png" alt="Consumer Fraud" width="800" height="292" />Being a responsible consumer in the year 2019 means educating yourself—not just on the products and services—but of the ways scammers and thieves exploit consumer behavior for their own financial gain. As technology advances with the convenience of <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/02/sim-card-swapping-scams-leave-businesses-vulnerable/">SMS text messaging as a security feature</a>, financial applications that put your finances at your fingertips, and the tangled world wide web, consumer fraud scams will only continue to mutate and evolve. Here are five of the most common types of consumer fraud scams to avoid in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Mortgage Fraud</strong></p>
<p>According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Financial Fraud Unit, mortgage fraud exploits a consumer’s fear of losing their home to make a quick buck. Mortgage fraud schemes come in many forms, including but not limited to equity skimming, loan modifications, and foreclosure rescue schemes. The perpetrators behind these schemes are often former real estate professionals who use their intimate knowledge of mortgages to swindle homeowners in distress. Real estate agents who are currently employed can exploit their authority to bolster the validity of their scheme. The FBI and FTC advise that consumers should be wary of any unsolicited phone calls, emails, regarding their home finances, and never sign any paperwork or documentation that they do not fully comprehend.</p>
<p><strong>Debit Card Fraud</strong></p>
<p>Debit card fraud occurs when an individual’s debit card information is obtained to make fraudulent purchases. Debit card fraud is one of the most difficult schemes to avoid in day-to-day life, because so many Americans have gradually transitioned from carrying cash to carrying only their debit card as means of legal tender. Anyone with access to the debit card’s information—including the businesses and vendors we trust every day—can pull this information to commit a fraud. Unfortunately, the only recourse consumers have in protecting themselves is to avoid letting their card ever leave their sight, and to keep a watchful eye on their accounts and report any suspicious activity.</p>
<p><strong>Charity Fraud</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most despicable types of consumer fraud is charity fraud. Scammers set up shell organizations to receive donations that do not go to those in need, but rather line the scammer’s pockets. Frauds of these type spike significantly during the holidays and in the wake of natural disasters in order to exploit humankind’s benevolence. The name of the game with charities is research. Any charity worth its salt is going to stand up to a great deal of due-diligence and fact-finding. Part of being a responsible consumer is knowing where your money is going.</p>
<p><strong>Lottery Fraud</strong></p>
<p>Winning the lottery is a dream of many Americans, with fantasies of kicking back and never having to put in another hard day’s work for the rest of their lives. Despite the wide range of demographics with these dreams, lottery fraud scams usually effect senior citizens in the United States. The scam usually begins with a letter or email letting the individual know they have won. The correspondence usually includes details about fees that are involved with receiving their winnings. The FTC warns that individuals who have won a legitimate lottery prize of any kind should never have to pay a fee to collect their winnings, and consumers should be suspect of any unsolicited correspondence stating as such. Consumers should also be advised that United States law does not support the sale and transference of international lottery tickets, so any correspondence from international lotteries is most certainly a scam.</p>
<p><strong>Identity Fraud</strong></p>
<p>Studies by Javelin Strategy &amp; Research conducted over the last seven years indicate that in 2017, there were as many as 16.7 million Americans impacted by identity fraud, with $16.8 million in stolen funds and assets. Identity theft can be committed for a number of reasons. Perpetrators can steal an individual’s information with the purpose of starting over again under a different name, or to escape their creditors. Most commonly, however, identity fraud is simply committed with the explicit purpose of stealing money from American consumers. Once a scammer has an individual’s identifying information, like dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and their mother’s maiden name, they can use that data to make fraudulent purchases in the victim’s name, withdraw funds from their bank accounts, and destroy their credit, leaving them financially arrested. The aftermath of identity fraud is devastating and can cause shockwaves across decades with exponential consequences.</p>
<p>If you have been the victim of a <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/01/shutdown-consumer-fraud-investigations-halted/">consumer fraud scam</a>, contact a private investigator today to learn how their unique set of skills and professional autonomy can help you locate the scammer in your midst.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1998" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/videogame_36180671.png" alt="predators online gaming" width="1317" height="349" /></p>
<p>Advances in technology are constantly changing the dialogue about how we protect our children from potential predators. Over the last decade, parents have had to reform their strategy when it comes to protecting their child in the real world. Before, parents cautioned their kids on stranger danger, special code words, and remaining aware of their surroundings in public. In a new era of unfettered internet access through multiple smart devices, parents had to contend with the real world being brought into their homes, with predators targeting their children through social media. Now, it appears parents will yet again have to add some new pages to the playbook when it comes to protecting their children from predators on video game platforms with integrated social networking.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents with children between the ages of 12-25 will likely be familiar with the online first-person shooter video game known as </span><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/buy-now"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortnite</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the game, 100 players at a time compete to be the last one standing in a battle-royale style of combat. The game features a chat feature allowing players to communicate in team efforts and other uses. It has great potential to foster team building and cooperation between young people, but also has a dark side recently illuminated by an arrest made in Florida in late January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities arrested 41-year-old, </span><a href="https://foxillinois.com/news/local/predators-using-popular-video-game-to-lure-children-09-25-2018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony Thomas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a man who allegedly used </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortnite’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instant-messaging feature to groom over 20 minors, including a 17-year-old, with whom law enforcement allege he had a sexual relationship. The Florida Attorney General’s Office also stated Thomas has been charged with 22 counts of possession of child pornography, and other charges related to his unlawful sexual relationship with the minor. Investigators uncovered he groomed the minors by sending them gifts—including a cell phone so their communication could remain more private.  Ashley Moody, Attorney General, remarked about the predation perpetrated, “This case is disturbing, not only because it involves child pornography, but also because a popular online game was used to communicate with the victim.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grooming is defined as “a process by which a child predator gains the trust of a victim by building a relationship with the child and then breaking down his or her defenses.” Once a predator has earned their trust, they begin exploitation. Minors who are groomed in the gaming community are particularly vulnerable because the predator may literally be on their team. Cooperative play between players fosters a healthy, “there’s no ‘I’ in TEAM,” mentality, but predators use this relationship to manipulate the minor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of a predator’s greatest weapons when grooming a minor online is pop culture. The predator—perhaps unlike the minor’s parents—shows their target they’re “hip and cool”, and are able to converse at their level about something they enjoy. This causes the minor to lower their guard, and the predator begins their manipulation game, culminating in the exploitation of said  minor. Online gaming is becoming so ubiquitous predators have developed a way to sense when a minor’s gaming is suddenly being supervised. The moment a minor’s behavior changes—they stop responding to messages, or do so uncharacteristically—the predator can pick up on that and cease all communication before they’re caught. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, even if a parent is supervising the communication between their minor child and other players online, it doesn’t mean they cannot be groomed. In the grooming process, between the introduction and the beginning of the exploitation, predators often suggest moving their communications to a third-party app, like What’sApp or Snapchat. These are apps where communications disappear with ease, and a parent performing their due-diligence in supervising their child’s internet safety may not notice, or even know how to access.</span><a href="https://www.teensafe.com/blog/predators-groom-children-gaming-online/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TeenSafe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says it’s critical parents learn to recognize the signs of grooming in their minor child. </span></p>
<p><b>Signs of Grooming<img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1997 alignright" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Master.png" alt="predators and online gaming " width="635" height="955" /><br />
</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your child wants to spend more time online or playing games on a console, but won’t tell you why. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your child does not want to discuss what he or she does online, or what websites he or she visits. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You notice your child is using inappropriate language he or she would not have heard within your home or at school. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you walk in a room, your child quickly changes the computer screen, mutes the volume on their gaming console, or turns it off all together. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortnite and other games with similar messaging platforms have been on law enforcement’s radar for the last few years as the instances of these cases continues to grow. In August of 2018, Titania Jordan, a digital safety expert, appeared on </span><a href="https://www.thedoctorstv.com/articles/how-to-keep-kids-safe-online-predators-while-playing-video-games"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Doctors</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide parents with helpful tips—not just for supervising their children’s gaming—but also for establishing boundaries that can nip grooming in the bud. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not allow minors to have computers, game consoles, or tablets in their room without supervision. Keeping these devices in common areas will increase visibility and deter predators from targeting them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instruct your child to never reveal any personal information about themselves to people they’ve met online, especially very specific information, such as where they live or where they go to school. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a culture of openness in your home where children feel comfortable coming to you if they feel uncomfortable about an interaction they’ve had online. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People of all ages play video games, but the vast majority of players are either minors or young adults, and parents often find themselves overwhelmed with the strange new world of online gaming. Titania Jordan reminded parents knowledge is power, recommending they verse themselves in the games their children play. This can only heighten your ability to detect when something is off. This means doing research online, and actively listening when your children describe normal gameplay behavior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an internet connection in your home may feel like you’re inviting predators into your home. And true, there’s no time to supervise every single activity your child does online. This is why it’s so important to nurture an open line of communication between parent and child. Not only will parents be able to sense when something is amiss in their child’s online interactions, but a strong bond between parent and child makes it less likely that an online predator will be able to isolate the child emotionally and manipulate them for the purposes of exploitation. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1993" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/colorado-adoption.jpeg" alt="colorado-adoption" width="565" height="307" />As the Western idealization of a family unit continues to grow and change, more and more parents are either opting to place their child for adoption or adopt themselves rather than have a biological child. As such, adoptions are on the rise. </span><a href="https://adoptionnetwork.com/adoption-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Adoption Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates the number of children in foster care at any given time in the United States is around 428,000. Of that staggering number, about 135,000 are adopted every year. Children are put up for adoption under a wide umbrella of circumstances in varying degrees of frequency, but what is not uncommon is a child’s adolescent or adult curiosity about the exact nature of where they came from. Because adoption agencies have their own privacy restrictions regarding birth parents, adopted children are often left with only a few meager details and options. Private investigators, however, are well-equipped to find a child’s birth parents; with a comprehensive tool chest and a wealth of experience in searching for persons who may or may not want to be found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate at which information technology is developing has been denoted by some as Orwellian, but the ubiquity of public databases and fact-finding software available to the public is higher than ever. Hiring a private investigator may be costlier to the individual than conducting the search oneself, but without the proper tools and expertise, individuals can follow false leads and dead ends for years at the cost of their time and personal finances. Private investigators, especially ones who specialize in locating biological relatives, can cut down the time and expense individuals would ultimately incur during their search. The complexity of adoption laws and procedures (often varying state-to-state) is a knot of cable wires that is difficult for any private citizen to untangle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private investigators </span><a href="https://www.trustify.info/services/birth-child-or-birth-parent-locate-investigation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a variety of specialties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are suited for this work because there is no chain of command in their business. Most notably, private investigators are often their own bosses, with the freedom to pick and choose the cases they want to focus on. Unlike the underpaid, overworked civil servants who work in child services, or the overwhelmed agents at an adoption agency, private investigators only handle less than a half-dozen cases at one time, so an adoption case will not just become another folder in a tall, precariously leaning pile on someone’s desk. There are no jurisdictional boundaries preventing a private investigator from going across state lines, as long as they are licensed in the state or being contracted by a private investigator who is licensed in the state. While there are limitations to what information can be gathered from the state based on the birth-parents wishes, the autonomy of a private investigator is ideal for tracking down either birth parents, or children who have been placed for adoption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Child Welfare Information Gateway estimates, of all parents placing their biological children for adoption, nearly half of those parents will then seek out those children after they have reached adulthood. Parents in search of a biological child always have a search advantage as the legal adult at the time of the adoption. They play a pivotal role in establishing the boundaries that might preclude this child from ever contacting them again in the future. Depending on the terms of the adoption agreement, the adoption agency may not be able to release information about anonymous birth parents to their biological children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The privacy laws surrounding adoption in the United States date back to the beginning of the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, and were put in place to protect the privacy and identity of all parties involved in an adoption. It’s only in recent years that the </span><a href="https://www.trustify.info/services/birth-child-or-birth-parent-locate-investigation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adoption Information Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has made it possible for both parents and children to request information about the other in situations where all of the aforementioned parties have waived their right to privacy. Adoption laws have also gone through a metamorphosis in recent decades where parents are required to fill out detailed medical histories for the benefit of the child’s physical and mental health growing up. In addition to information about their own birth (date, location, hospital), a birth parent’s medical background might be the only information an adopted child possesses.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locating a birth parent or child is a form of investigation known as a skip trace. “Skip” refers to the action of searching for a person, derived from an old colloquialism, “to skip town,” or leave with very little notice or instruction. Trace refers to the process and resources involved in finding the person, such as international online databases, surveillance, and location technology and services. Skip traces in adoption cases can go both ways: A child in search of their birth parents, or a birth parent in search of the child they placed. Private investigators who take adoption skip traces have a mountain of data to sift through, including adoption registries, religion-related services (such as options offered through the Catholic church) and a mountain of databases, including—but not limited to—welfare, child protective services, private adoption agency, foster care, police, court, hospital, and international records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the level of information available to either a birth parent or biological child (and subsequently the investigator) adoption cases can have a mixed bag of possible results. In scenarios where a private investigator is unable to find a birth parent, it’s typically because there is not enough information on the record to begin with. Because of varying degrees of regulation across all adoption agencies (both state and private), the level of information and quality of record keeping is a crap-shoot, and investigators often hit dead ends in those types of investigations. In other circumstances, after many long hours of research and investigation, the private investigator is able to locate the birth child or parent, only to report back to the client the subject in question has no desire to reunite with them in any fashion. These are solutions often unsatisfactory to the client, but it is a difficult reality, and the client will have some semblance of closure regarding their questions about the subject. However, in the event private investigators locate the birth child or parent, and the subject is willing to re-initiate contact, private investigators can be ideal liaisons to bringing biological parents and children together in adulthood. They can alleviate some of the most common anxieties surrounding meeting strangers, and have experience with reconnecting displaced parties that will inform a gradual process of reestablishing contact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life has an infinite potential to get messy very quickly, and a child being placed for adoption is one of the consequences of the indeterminate. Fortunately, private investigators not only have the sleuth skills to find persons under all circumstances, but an acute ability to read people that benefits the precarious nature of the cases they take on. When a birth parent and child are open to meeting again under more pleasant circumstances, private investigators can build strong bridges across decades of separation, confusion, and curiosity. </span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States government has been shut down for almost four weeks, sending shockwaves throughout a nation already gripped by tumultuous politics and controversial issues. In addition to institutions like the National Parks System, and the National Institute of Health, all federal employees have currently been laid off from duty, and a majority of their services suspended. The ripple effect is dizzying, with many of the governments services being on hold for the duration of the shutdown. Many consumers across the country are not aware of the shutdown’s impact on some of our nation’s best departments, so you can imagine their shock when they phoned to report a consumer complaint, and were told the government couldn’t help them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When running normally, the government requires a wealth of quality communication to run smoothly. As many federal employees remain on furlough, therefore not being compensated, everyone’s level of communication with one another is atypical and—as many federal employees are called in without pay—constantly breaking down. </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CFPB) is the federal agency that fields the influx of consumer complaints. A consumer submits their complaint about a business or financial entity to the CFPB, which is reviewed. According to the CFPB, after the complaint is reviewed, “We’ll forward your complaint and any documents you provide to the company and work to get a response from them. If we find that another government agency would be better able to assist, we will forward your complaint to them and let you know.” The CFPB </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-cfpb-complaint-database-20180608-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remains in operation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was not effected by the shutdown, but if the agency is ill-equipped to deal with the complaint, they may never get off the ground, as the appropriate department might be effected by the shutdown. This leaves many consumers displaced when it comes to voicing their concerns about products and services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1705" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/la-fi-lazarus-fcc-robocalls-20160729-snap-1024x576.jpg" alt="la-fi-lazarus-fcc-robocalls-20160729-snap" width="1024" height="576" />This suspension of protection services has allowed the beast of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/01/11/latest-threat-government-shutdown-more-robocalls/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b87b54cdf358"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robo-calls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fester and become feral, as consumers cannot block or report harassing robo-calls. They’re left screaming into the void. Alex Quilici, the chief executive of YouMail—a smartphone application that helps consumers block robo-calls—describes it, “It’s a neighborhood with no police on the beat.” YouMail estimated, just last month, there were 5 billion robo-calls made, and 50% of calls made in early 2019 could be coming from scammers and robots attempting to fraudulently obtain your information. These horrifying statistics are the codas for a chorus of federal employees who are aware of the scope of the problem, like Jessica Rosenworcel, the Federal Communications Commission Commissioner, “The number of robo-calls consumers are receiving is insane. The problem just keeps growing. Shutting down the government is not going to help.” As of this moment, there is no one to administrate the “Do Not Call” list, the national registry in which consumers can ask specific companies not to contact them. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.acainternational.org/news/online-services-for-consumers-and-business-impacted-by-government-shutdown"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Communications Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just one of many threads woven into the Federal Trade Commission. Another voiceless victim of the shutdown is the victim of identity fraud. Louette Duvall is one of these victims. Not long after the holidays were over, Duvall’s car was pilfered by thieves while she was at her job. They made off with her purse, her briefcase, and a wealth of identifying information that amounted to a scammer’s treasure trove. Fraudulent charges started rolling in as she scrambled to alert all of her creditors and financial institutions that she had been robbed. She began calculating the full scope of </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/shutdown-blocks-help-identity-theft-victims-ftc-goes-dark-n957721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the theft’s ramifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: New checkbooks ordered, extravagant items ordered in her name, new credit cards, the list goes on and on. When she called the Federal Trade Commission to let them know her identity had been stolen, she was told they could not help her due to the government shutdown. FTC data prior to the shutdown stated that the agency received thousands of calls a day regarding identity theft alone. That’s thousands of crimes going uninvestigated every day, a Washington Post reporter pointed out when they became a victim as well. Not only are new crimes going unreported, but investigative resources are also frozen. The Consumer Sentinel Network helps investigators track the movement of identity theft and related frauds to build cases against the perpetrators, and it remains down as of day 26 of the longest government shutdown in history. At a minimum, the FTC is still allowing individuals to file complaints so that they be issued an affidavit for their creditors’ purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News coverage of the shutdown has attempted to sharpen the big picture for Americans when it comes to the ripple effect of the government shutdown. While many federal agencies might be </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/15/shutdown-impact-inspection-finance-investigation-1079014"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to assist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consumers with complaints, there is recourse for consumers experiencing the myriad of issues helmed by the Federal Trade Commission. There are online, step-by-step resources for obtaining documentation to dispute fraudulent charges and claims. Consumers can also retain the services of a private investigator. One of the most beneficial aspects of hiring a private investigator is that they are the top of the chain of command in their firm. They are the ones calling the shots in any investigation, not a supervisor nor a superior. They will represent your interests and your interests alone. As is the case with many frauds and thefts, perpetrators tend to either operate remotely, or move quickly to evade law enforcement. Acting independently, private investigators will be able to move as fluidly as a scammer, crossing jurisdictional boundaries with little to no red tape. Statistics surrounding fraud indicate that many federal investigators in charge of tracking down scammers and thieves are inundated with a never-ending stream of complaints. This means their attention can be divided over and over again across a heavy caseload. A typical private investigator only handles between 3-4 cases at a time, meaning your case can be a priority for them and not just another file in a drawer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political pundits and talking heads don’t project a sunny forecast when it comes to the shutdown—no end in sight. As the shutdown enters its 27</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> day, many Americans who have been the victims of consumer fraud and identity theft who do not yet know the full scope of the shutdown’s impact will receive an ugly surprise when they turn to the federal government for help. While the government gets its house in order, know that there are options for victims of consumer and identity fraud. Consult a private investigator today to learn how their specific skill set, experience, and independence can help you get right the ship when it comes to fraud. </span></p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1970" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/child-1024x526.png" alt="child safety" width="1024" height="526" />How easy would it be to kidnap a child in a crowded place? Maybe the park, walking home from school or even sleeping in their own bedroom. Over again, we see parents of missing children making pleas for the safe return of their children on the news. We see the Amber Alerts and Facebook posts and immediately picture our own children’s faces, thinking “What if it happened to me?” A common reaction to something so traumatic.</p>
<p>A young child becoming the victim of a predator is every parent’s worst nightmare, but the fact is, it is happening every day to parents throughout the country and our own fears do not wane just because our children are getting older.</p>
<p>I am a parent of four grown children and a mother who has worked in the field of missing persons for over 25 years. Every day I interacted with parents who were desperately searching for their missing child. Their pain unimaginable. Very quickly I realized the crime of abduction does not discriminate based upon a child’s age.</p>
<p>Commonly, we think of small children when we hear the word kidnapping and we think as our children age, they are safer, but the fact is, they can become even more vulnerable as they approach adulthood.</p>
<p>While teenagers are venturing out, without the protective eye of a parent, there is even more chance they can cross paths with a potential kidnapper. It is our responsibility as parents to guide our children throughout their lives and hopefully provide them with some tools that will keep them safe.</p>
<p>According to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), approximately 800,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States. That number accounts for nearly 2,000 per day.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimates a relatively small number, approximately 115 of those missing children are abducted by strangers and listed as an “involuntary” abduction in the national database of missing children. However, this number does not account for children (to include teens), who are listed in the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) in various categories such as “Endangered Missing,” “Runaways” or “Other.” Many of these disappearances are considered “long-term” with more than a year having passed with no resolution or explanation as to how or why the child disappeared. The fact is, we just don’t know, therefor accurate statistics impossible.</p>
<p>One thing we all can do as parents is prepare our children. Much of the following information and tools have proven to save lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Communicate with your children</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Predators do not look like the “Boogieman.” Strangers look like everyone else. Children need to understand that everyone is a stranger, even women and seniors. It is not about being unsociable, explaining this is about being cautious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Agree to a code word</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Strangers have no business asking a child for directions or a lost pet. Many times, a predator will try to coerce a child into coming with them voluntarily without causing a scene by telling them they were sent by their parents to pick the child up. Agree to a simple “code word” like “Giraffe” or “Cheetos” that your child can remember and tell them to only trust an adult who knows the code word.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Walking Away</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Children should be taught to trust their instincts and walk away if a stranger approaches them. Though not all people are dangerous, it is always more important to be safe than being polite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Don’t put your child’s name on personal items</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Children will tend to trust others who know their name. Never put your child’s name on personal items such as clothing or backpacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Just scream</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If approached, children should be taught to scream and run. Reassure your child the likelihood of being approached by a stranger is minimal but should it happen, to scream “This is not my dad” or “Fire” while running away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1971" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mpposter-1024x633.png" alt="missing child" width="1024" height="633" />The stakes are high when a child becomes the target of a predator. It really is a matter of life or death. According to the FBI, statistically when a child is abducted by a stranger, the likelihood of recovering them alive diminishes with each hour that passes.</p>
<p>When a predator has targeted its prey, survival depends upon fighting back. For example, if approached with a knife or gun and told to get in a car, statistically the child or teen have more of a chance surviving if they fight back at the initial crime scene. Survival rates drop when a child is transported to a second crime scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Communication</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As children get older and spend more time away from parents, it is important to communicate openly with them. They need to know the dangers and reality of abduction without feeling fear which can be paralyzing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Not alone</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Children should never answer the door when home alone or answer the phone and tell the caller their parent is not home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>No compromises</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Use the “Buddy System” and teens should always inform their parents where they are going and with who. No compromises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>No shortcuts</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Children should avoid shortcuts through empty parks, fields, and alleys. It is better to always remain in a well populated area to be safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Life-saving technology </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Use a GPS on their phone. There are free Apps such as Life 360. The App can be loaded on both the child’s phone and the parent’s phone and track location. Personally, my children are all grown with their own families now but my daughter and I both use Life 360 to keep tabs on each other. Though teens may demand their space, their safety trumps the right to privacy.</p>

<p>Remember, promote a home atmosphere that is open so kids can let you know what is going on in their lives. It is important to help them to have an understanding and confidence you want the best for them. Thomas Lauth has been in the private investigation industry for over 30 years, and in the cases of missing children, he stresses the importance of communication between parent and child, &#8220;We often get calls for missing children and teens. Once located and reunited with their families, we often educate parents or caregivers on tenets that would prevent this from occurring again. Regardless of circumstances, the most important thing is communication. Not only open and honest communication between parent and child, but communication safety concerning things like social media. In a world where young people are glued to their devices, it&#8217;s paramount that they remember to have awareness of their surroundings. Communicate, Educate, Communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Teaching children techniques to avoid an abduction</strong></p>
<p>The window of opportunity to save oneself from danger might be seconds and children need to feel confident enough to make a split-second decision. In addition to coercion, abductors use intimidation. There are some techniques you can practice at home to build their self-confidence should they ever be face to face with a kidnapper.</p>
<ol>
<li>Practice yelling “Stop, Stranger” or “Fire” to draw attention and yell as loud as they can.</li>
<li>Practice the Windmill technique which means rotating arms in a big circle so a potential attacker can’t get a good grip.</li>
<li>Practice the Velcro technique by having your child grab and hold onto something, not letting go. They should also learn to scream while doing this.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a child is abducted and somehow placed in a vehicle, they should know they need to take any opportunity they can to escape while trying to keep a cool head.</p>
<ol>
<li>Children should be taught not to be passive but proactive.</li>
<li>Try to open the passenger side door quickly or jump in the back seat and try to escape through the rear doors.</li>
<li>If placed in a trunk, they should be taught not to panic but to look for the “release” that opens the trunk upon pulling on it. Tear all the wires to the tail lights and brakes if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know this is a very serious and scary topic and just the thought of having to explain to an innocent child that some people are out to hurt them is incredibly uncomfortable, but when teaching others about fire safety, Benjamin Franklin said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” It applies throughout life.</p>
