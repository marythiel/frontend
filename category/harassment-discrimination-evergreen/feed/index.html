<p>In a landmark decision, a federal jury recently awarded $2.17 million against <a href="https://www.skywest.com/">SkyWest Airlines</a> for subjecting a female parts clerk to a sexually hostile work environment. The jury&#8217;s verdict — the largest ever obtained by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the Northern District of Texas — underscores the critical importance of maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment.</p>



<p>The airline employee — Sarah Budd — endured crude sexual comments from multiple coworkers and at least one manager, including lude suggestions that she engage in prostitution and perform demeaning sex acts. According to the EEOC, additional disturbing jokes about women who report sexual assault were commonplace. Despite Budd&#8217;s reports to her supervisor and the employee relations department, SkyWest&#8217;s investigations were insufficient, leading to lackluster disciplinary actions and canceled training sessions intended to address the harassment.</p>



<p>This case doubles down on the severe consequences organizations face when they fail to address workplace harassment effectively. Beyond legal repercussions, such negligence can lead to reputational damage and a decline in employee morale.</p>

<p>Picture this: a workplace where employees feel respected, safe, and valued. Sounds good, right! Unfortunately, this is not always an ideal situation. The study by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revealed that workplace violence affects about 2 million people every year in the United States alone. These figures may be scary and mitigate your determination to conduct business. Fear not, as there are well-proven strategies that you can implement to safeguard your employees and organization. This article will discuss five effective methods to create a working environment where safety reigns supreme.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Comprehensive Prevention Policy</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine a castle without robust walls; it will be prone to attacks. Similarly, the organization and employees are at risk without a workable prevention policy in the workplace. Policies are internally created and customized to fit the nature of your business. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all policies, as different organizations engage in activities with varied levels of risk. Studies have shown that workplaces with clear violence policies report lower incidences. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine indicates that companies with violence policies experience 40% fewer cases than those without such guidelines.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The policy should define terms such as harassment, verbal abuse, and physical violence, which employees experience in the workplace. Notably, this policy document should also clearly indicate the reporting procedure, the disciplinary action to be taken, and the supportive mechanism for the victims. While some human resource directors might consider this a lot of work, it improves productivity. We, as Lauth, will conduct a proper violence assessment to give you insight into how well-prepared you are for incidences of violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Training and Creating Awareness among the Employees</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is self-fulfilling for a business owner to have a vigilant team that can detect threats. Employee training equips them with the necessary skills, such as interpersonal skills and conflict management, which makes them handle issues that could result in violence. The leading cause of violence within the workplace is a lack of understanding among the workforce, and appreciating diversity lessens violence. Investing in training saves time that could have been used to solve the conflict. For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) study showed that companies that invested in workplace violence training experienced a 70% reduction in workplace violence. Arm your team with knowledge!</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting Rigorous Risk Assessment</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps you cannot perceive the inherent risk that violence can bring to your business because it has never happened. Or better put, take into consideration an employee who gets injured while at work due to an incidence of violence, such as a physical altercation. Picture that regarding litigations related to work injury benefit claims, and I am sure you will appreciate the need to fortify your defense. A regular risk assessment identifies the vulnerabilities within your business. Through our experienced risk assessment investigator, we identify weak points in your system and provide a comprehensive report on improvements.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing Workplace Violence Prevention Teams</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Having a dedicated team of guardians for preventing workplace violence is the best thing you can gift your business this year. This team is instrumental in ensuring petty issues resulting from violence are handled out immediately before they escalate. A small problem, such as miscommunication, can snowball into physical or verbal abuse. It is prudent to establish a workplace violence prevention team consisting of experts from different departments, and their primary role would be to develop and implement violence prevention strategies.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:image {"id":165943,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="545" height="558" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2.png" alt="Proactive Strategies for Preventing Workplace Violence" class="wp-image-165943" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2.png 545w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2-480x491.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 545px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Organizations with a workable workplace violence prevention team are good at establishing potential threats before they happen. This is supported by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), which indicated that 80% of the companies with violence prevention teams reported a decrease in workplace violence incidences. As a starting point, develop a violence prevention team and track the cases within the first year. The outcome will be appealing, and for you to achieve this, we suggest helping you with a corporate culture audit to serve as a mirror of exactly how prepared you are in regard to workplace violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting a Culture of Respect and Support</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Build solidarity among your employees. Being united is a compact pillar in mitigating violence in the workplace. Successful organizations foster a culture of respect and support, which essentially prevents violence in the workforce. This is because the employees feel valued, and they tend to propagate the value of respect to the advantage of the business. How do you cultivate a culture of support and respect? This happens through encouraging open communication and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination. These approaches create a sense of belonging, preventing conflict from escalating into violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is undeniably true that workplace violence impedes an organization&#8217;s growth and lowers productivity. As the workforce continues to become more diverse, the chances of conflicts, hence violence, would continue in the workplace. Therefore, it is wrong to sit and wait until an incident happens in order to act. This article has highlighted the different strategies you can adopt for your enterprise and stand out in averting the repercussions that tag along with violence. Lauth can help you with your violence assessment, risk assessment, and corporate audit to mitigate violence.</p>

<p>In the modern way of doing business, fostering a working environment of respect, inclusivity, and diversity is not only a requirement but a legal mandate. This has happened due to the changing market dynamics, where the world is now a global village. Interconnectedness has increased, and therefore, there is a need to enhance cultural respect. However, harassment and discrimination continue to be a pervasive issue, derailing the morale of the workers and also limiting organizational growth.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>To deal with these challenges effectively, an organization is supposed to employ proactive strategies that ensure equality and respect. The actionable steps discussed in this article would benefit a business that wants to avert the challenges of harassment and discrimination in the workplace and improve productivity.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Latitude of the problem</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Before engaging ourselves in actual steps that can be used to deal with harassment and discrimination, it is paramount to understand the prevalence and impact of the issue. According to the report released by the Employment Opportunity Commission (EOC), it was noted that about 33% of the cases reported to them related to workplace harassment. It also informs that the highest form of discrimination is centered on race, gender, age, and disability.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>This shows a problem; we cannot hide our heads under the sand and assume everything is okay. Human resource directors have a role to play, especially in the present era, where penetration of technology has allowed a diverse workforce, which is a trigger to discrimination and harassment.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting Awareness through Training</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Employees might lack the proper knowledge regarding the harm they bring to an organization through discrimination and harassment. On equal measure, the executives charged with the mandates of upholding the company&#8217;s integrity might fail to comprehend how a simple act of favoritism has on corporate culture. This lack of information is what training on harassment and discrimination comes to fill.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The workforce is taught how to relate with each other and work as a team, and the overall impact on the organization&#8217;s success. The training can be executed through workshops and scenario-based simulations. In that regard, a human resource director needs to fully understand the nature of the culture in the workplace by conducting a corporate culture audit, a service well executed by Lauth&#8217;s team of experts. Our private investigators are trained to move unseen; therefore, the report you get reflects the actual situation of your workplace regarding harassment and discrimination.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Clear Policies and Procedures</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Why do some workers face stressful levels of harassment and discrimination in the working environment with all levels of management? It is astonishing to note that even large multinationals have reported cases of discrimination and harassment. This, therefore, leaves us with the question of how the small and medium businesses are, where we expect the formality to be ignored. The single answer to this is the lack of an anti-harassment policy; if it is there, it is just a document to show compliance and is less discussed in departmental meetings.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Research by the International Labour Organization (ILO) established that companies with anti-harassment policies are more likely to effectively deal with issues of workplace harassment. This is because the policy defines the process of reporting, dealing with disciplinary cases, and handling the affected person. One of the examples where this policy has worked is at Walmart. The retailer strengthened its anti-harassment policy by enforcing zero-tolerance to harassment. We know the employees might fear reporting harassment and discrimination cases to human resource office. Lauth has a dedicated hotline that you can leverage, and we do the investigation work for you as you concentrate on other duties.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fostering a Culture of Accountability</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Leaders play a pivotal role in swaying the behavior of the workers. The manager, departmental heads, and those in supervisory roles are responsible for upholding the organizational culture, which sets the tone of acceptable behavior. As a human resource director, you are the organization&#8217;s engine, and the employees’ character dictates who you are. In that regard, holding yourself accountable for upholding positive values and inclusivity is beneficial. Set the agenda of zero discrimination or harassment in the workplace from day one when a new employee is hired. This would eventually cascade and be held as the culture of the organization.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>One way to ensure accountability is conducting a targeted recruitment. This involves assessing the workplace environment and identifying areas and unbalanced skills that need more stability. This would ensure that minority groups are included and expand the talent pool across. This has an overall effect of mitigating turnover and improving employees’ satisfaction.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Combating harassment and discrimination requires different approaches, as discussed above. Similarly, an organization must prioritize a culture of inclusivity and respect since it creates a supportive working environment. This means that the human resource department has a critical responsibility to understand the weaknesses and strengths in their culture to institute necessary remedies. Together, we contribute towards a working environment where every worker feels respected and valued.</p>

<p>When an employee makes a report of workplace discrimination or harassment, it is important for the employer to conduct a thorough investigation. However, with the delicate nature of Equal Employment Opportunity investigations, leadership or human resources may not have the breadth of experience or resources to exercise due diligence. That&#8217;s why many companies initiate the process of hiring a private investigator for an EEO investigation. </p>



<p>A private investigator can bring a number of skills and experience to a corporate EEO investigation. They can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Conduct interviews with witnesses.</strong>&nbsp;A private investigator is trained to conduct interviews in a way that gathers accurate and unbiased information. They can also interview witnesses who may be reluctant to speak to the company&#8217;s human resources department.</li>



<li><strong>Gather documentary evidence.</strong>&nbsp;A private investigator can review documents, such as emails, text messages, and social media posts, that may be relevant to the investigation. They can also obtain copies of documents that are not in the company&#8217;s possession, such as medical records or employment records from previous employers.</li>



<li><strong>Conduct surveillance.</strong>&nbsp;In some cases, a private investigator may need to conduct surveillance to gather information about the incident. This may involve following the alleged harasser or observing their behavior.</li>



<li><strong>Write a comprehensive report.</strong>&nbsp;At the end of the investigation, the private investigator will write a comprehensive report that summarizes the findings. This report will be used by the company to determine whether discrimination or harassment has occurred. Leadership will then plan a proper course of action.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Benefits of Hiring a Private Investigator for an EEO Investigation</h2>



<p>There are a number of benefits to hiring a private investigator to conduct an EEO investigation. These benefits include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Impartiality.</strong>&nbsp;A private investigator is not affiliated with the company, so they can provide an impartial and objective view of the situation. Their perspective will also come in handy should any litigation arrive as the result of the investigation. </li>



<li><strong>Experience.</strong>&nbsp;Private investigators have experience conducting investigations, so they know how to gather evidence and interview witnesses.</li>



<li><strong>Confidentiality.</strong>&nbsp;Private investigators are bound by confidentiality, so they can ensure that the investigation is conducted in a confidential manner.</li>
</ul>



<p>If your company receives a report of workplace discrimination or harassment, it is important to conduct a thorough investigation. By hiring a private investigator, you can ensure that the investigation is conducted in a fair, impartial, and confidential manner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some additional tips:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Get recommendations from other businesses.</strong> Ask other businesses in your industry if they have experience hiring a private investigator for an EEO investigation and if they were satisfied with the results.</li>



<li><strong>Interview several investigators.</strong>&nbsp;Interview several private investigators to get a feel for their experience and qualifications.</li>



<li><strong>Get everything in writing.</strong>&nbsp;Before hiring a private investigator, get everything in writing, including the scope of the investigation, the fees, and the confidentiality agreement.</li>
</ul>



<p>By following these tips, you can ensure that you hire a qualified and experienced private investigator to conduct your EEO investigation.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pexels-yan-krukov-7640808-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-135268" width="582" height="873"/></figure></div>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to imagine that most business owners, leaders, or HR managers would feel a sense of trepidation after receiving a complaint of sexual harassment on their watch. In the post “<em>me too</em>” era, we collectively share a far greater awareness of the damaging impacts of this kind of misconduct—not to mention the potential pitfalls for businesses that poorly navigate a complaint and decisions around mounting a sexual harassment investigation.</p>



<p>However, sexual harassment at work statistics continue to highlight a substantial problem across the United States. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reveals that <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/data/sexual-harassment-our-nations-workplaces">27,291 charges</a> alleging sexual harassment were brought between FY 2018 and FY 2021 alone, and those numbers don&#8217;t reflect the reality that <a href="https://inspiredelearning.com/blog/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-statistics/">almost three quarters</a> of sexual harassment claims in the workplace go unreported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these numbers point to an ongoing need within the corporate world for efforts to reduce the risks that might set a course towards any sexual harassment investigation, at least those faced with driving such corporate investigations can use the wisdom of those who have gone before them to shine a light toward resolution in the present moment and justice for potential victims. Critical to this process is swift action and a respectful approach to caring for employees while uncovering the truth. Read on for top tips from the Lauth Investigations International team about how to get this done right.</p>



<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Wait to Take Action</strong></p>



<p>As soon as a sexual harassment complaint is received, it is essential to take prompt action. This will include reporting the complaint to those relevant in the chain of command and the human resources department. The process of corporate investigations must begin right away, with any delay in doing so putting the victim and other employees in danger of further abuse. Dragged heals at this juncture may also steer an organization towards a lawsuit or fines if they are later found to have acted irresponsibly.</p>



<p><strong>Take Care Of Your Team</strong></p>



<p>Even though you don&#8217;t yet have all the facts, it is important to demonstrate how seriously the complaint is being taken while safeguarding the employees involved. This early step of a sexual harassment investigation calls for collaborating with the complainant to ensure they feel protected. You should be prepared to separate the complainant and the accused either by moving them to a new workstation or changing their scheduled hours. Alternatively, you may decide it is most appropriate to put the accused individual on paid leave until the matter is resolved.</p>



<p><strong>Ensure a Discreet and Unbiased Investigation</strong></p>



<p>A sexual harassment investigation can turn the lives of those in its orbit upside down if not handled with care. Every aspect of the investigation must be approached with confidentiality and discretion in mind. Perhaps more importantly, the investigation must be free from bias. This can be particularly challenging in any workplace setting as members of different departmental teams often socialize together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The person chosen to lead the investigation cannot have a relationship with the complainant employee, the individual subject to the allegation, or any witnesses. Any indications of bias may upend the legal standing of the conclusion of the investigation and any resulting action taken. So if in any doubt, it is always better to bring an external corporate investigator in to oversee the process.<br>Do you need support in <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/harassment-discrimination/">mounting a respectful sexual harassment investigation</a> in your workplace?

<p>Would you say your business has a clear-cut anti-harassment policy? If you&#8217;re thinking, <em>“sure, zero-tolerance is baked into our businesses values,”</em> then you might need to dig a little deeper. That&#8217;s because this worrying indicator of corporate culture gone wrong doesn&#8217;t adhere to a bold mission statement or core values in a hand book—it relies upon real action and daily practices. You can&#8217;t prevent workplace harassment through thought alone. Your workplace&#8217;s leadership has to <em>live</em> it.</p>



<p>Workplace harassment—whether it comes in the form of bullying, discrimination, or sexual harassment—can hit any business, small or large. The ramifications can extend from distress and loss of productivity through to PR nightmares and law suits. Undoubtedly, prevention is the ideal path. So, lets break down real strategies that you can implement today.</p>



<p><strong>Get Your Workplace Harassment Policy Up To Date</strong></p>



<p>When was the last time your company policy on workplace harassment was reviewed and revitalized? It&#8217;s important that, periodically, policies are revisited and updated. They should be clear-cut and comprehensive, as well as complying with local, state, and federal regulations in regards to all forms of harassment and discrimination. If in doubt, <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/harassment-discrimination/">consult with an expert</a> to make sure that all aspects have been covered.</p>



<p><strong>Make Sure Anti-Harassment Values Are In All Employees&#8217; Vocabularies</strong></p>



<p>Just as nobody reads the fine-print these days, not all employees will be ready to recite every company policy—even of you provided them with a glossy print copy. That makes it your responsibility to keep company values alive in people&#8217;s minds. This can be achieved by sending out periodic memos, and instituting training and awareness programs. Establish clear expectations as to what acceptable and unacceptable workplace behavior looks like, and lead by example.</p>



<p><strong>Pass the Anti-Harassment Torch to Your Trusted Leaders</strong></p>



<p>Providing more intensive training to department heads, HR personnel, and executives can help you forge a culture within which harassment is unwelcome. In this way, positive reinforcement can come from many directions, making it more difficult for toxicity to take hold. Ensure that those carrying the torch know how to spot warning signs of harassment and make all employees aware of how to report workplace harassment. On something so important for the health of employees and the business itself, the door should always open.</p>



<p><strong>Forge A Strong and Healthy Corporate Culture</strong></p>



<p>A healthy corporate culture is always a goal worth striving for, because when employees feel nurtured and empowered, they are ultimately equipped to innovate and achieve. This means tangible value for any business, but more than that—it means a reduced risk of threats ranging from workplace harassment through to corporate theft or white-collar crime. If you are unsure of the current standing of your organization&#8217;s corporate culture, a Corporate Culture Audit can give you a comprehensive overview, as well as a clear road-map towards measurable improvements.</p>



<p><strong>Be Ready to Handle Complaints With Respect</strong></p>



<p>While every effort in prevention is worthwhile, it is impossible to eliminate the risk of workplace harassment entirely. If a member of your team files a complaint or one of your torch-bearers sees cause for concern, it&#8217;s crucial to be ready to launch a thorough, sensitive, and diligent investigation. In this endeavor, a seasoned external corporate investigator can be a powerful ally—ensuring that your investigation serves impartial justice while being by the book, optimally documented, and airtight against future legal scrutiny.<br>Why not discover more about <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-culture-audit/">Corporate Culture Audits</a> and support for <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/harassment-discrimination/">Workplace Harassment Investigations</a> from Lauth Investigations International.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="932" height="1024" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/handling_57452959-932x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-134134"/></figure></div>



<p>Recent years have seen activist movements such as “Me Too”, “Times Up”, and “Black Lives Matter” drive a positive paradigm shift. More and more people are standing up for their rights to live and work with dignity. This means that the businesses that take a workplace harassment complaint seriously shine brightly as contemporary leaders in their fields—while the businesses that don&#8217;t risk losing their relevance to consumers and potential recruits alike.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re here, then the chances are that you&#8217;re striving to secure your organization&#8217;s footing firmly within the first of those two camps. An essential port of call at the beginning of this journey is establishing a powerful anti-harassment policy, with crystal clear protocols to support it. Today we&#8217;re going to be discussing the best practices to incorporate when dealing with a harassment claim. Don&#8217;t forget, every harassment complaint poses a major risk to your organization, so—whether navigating a report of workplace bullying, discrimination, or sexual misconduct—attention to detail is vital.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Establishing a Complaints Procedure</strong></h3>



<p>Did you know that <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-releases-fiscal-year-2018-enforcement-and-litigation-data">more than 50%</a> of the filings that arrive with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission each year are retaliation complaints? Well, you do now—so it&#8217;s time to make sure that your complaints procedure is action-ready. Consistency is vital when handling workplace harassment complaints, so having a polished procedural roadmap to hand will be invaluable.</p>



<p>This protocol should be tailored to your organization&#8217;s size, resources, culture, and mandate. If you&#8217;re reading this article because a workplace harassment complaint is already on your desk—but there&#8217;s no up-to-date and established procedure to speak of—then consider this the perfect opportunity to create one that is iron-clad. Your complaints procedure should cover:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Outlining your organization&#8217;s anti-harassment policies</li><li>Handling all complaints with seriousness and professionalism</li><li>Acting quickly, while memories and evidence are fresh</li><li>Considering if protective steps are required on behalf of the complainant</li><li>Documentation resources and instructions</li><li>Interview procedures and order of interviews</li><li>The importance of an investigation timeline</li><li>Communication protocols—such as leadership immediately informing HR</li><li>The need to remain neutral to all parties</li><li>Whether managers, HR, or external investigators will take the lead</li><li>Maintaining confidentiality of all parties as far as possible</li><li>Making employees aware of their right to complain and who they can speak to</li><li>PR protocols if the harassment complaint goes public</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When a Complaint Has Been Received</strong></h3>



<p>When an accusation of workplace harassment has been made, time is of the essence. That said, every step taken should be with legal scrutiny in mind, so begin by efficiently making a plan of action and drawing necessary resources together. With legality and justice prioritized, the importance of documentation cannot be overstated.</p>



<p>All interviews and evidence gathered should be carefully documented and dated. It&#8217;s also vital to be aware that any written communication—such as emails—may also later become evidence if litigation follows. As such, caution, discretion, neutral language, and sticking to the known facts will serve you well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Safeguarding Your Organization&#8217;s Integrity</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond the need to protect your employees and ensure their well-being at work, it is also vital to protect your organization—both in terms of reputation and financial risk. All actions taken and conclusions draw must reflect a thorough and indiscriminate process. A robust approach for businesses aiming to ensure that they will not later be accused of bias is bringing in an external investigator. This type of specialist will be ready to support navigating any workplace harassment complaint with impeccable practice.</p>



<p>A seasoned corporate investigator from Lauth Investigations international will take the lead on your workplace investigation, lifting the associated stress from your team&#8217;s shoulders. By turning to their trusted services, you will be able to enjoy absolute confidence in the protocols followed, the quality of documentation, the capacity to stand up to legal scrutiny, and ultimately the conclusions drawn. This can alleviate what would otherwise be a logistical challenge and substantial burden on your HR team.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever been the victim of any kind of bullying or harassment knows that it can leave a person&#8217;s world turned upside down. For businesses getting to grips with how to minimize the risks of workplace harassment, it can be motivating to understand the far-reaching ramifications of these issues—from stalling team performance to broken brand reputation, and from dwindling profits through to swelling legal costs.</p>



<p>In truth, workplace bullying, discrimination, and sexual harassment create toxic work environments. They can have a crippling effect on the well-being and performance of many more employees than the victim or victims alone. Read on to discover the many pervasive impacts that these types of misconduct can have, before getting serious about upping your game in its prevention!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Risk to Health and Well-being</strong></h3>



<p>Being a victim of workplace harassment—or even simply witnessing it—can generate problems that your employees carry all day at the office, and back home with them at the end of the working day. These impacts can be both psychological and physical, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Stress</li><li>Anxiety</li><li>Panic attacks</li><li>Depression</li><li>Insomnia</li><li>Stomach ulcers</li><li>High blood pressure</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When Performance Suffers Along With the Victim</strong></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s hardly surprising that when employees are grappling with these kinds of pressures, their work performance will also take a hit. Be aware that symptoms of workplace harassment can manifest detrimentally on employee productivity:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Victims and witnesses may struggle to concentrate</li><li>Victims may lose self-esteem</li><li>Victims and witnesses may have trouble with decision-making</li><li>Victims and witnesses may avoid excelling in order to avoid attention</li><li>Victims and witnesses may be reluctant to enter communal settings</li><li>Harassers may also underperform while distracted by their misconduct</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Your Business Dropping the Ball?</strong></h3>



<p>Contemporary employers understand that happy employees are engaged employees—and minimizing the risk of workplace bullying, sexual harassment, and all forms of discrimination, is an important element of ensuring that teams remain at their most energized. However, the risk to companies that drop the ball on workplace harassment extend far further than productivity losses alone:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Increased sick leave, rehabilitation, and health insurance costs</li><li>Pervasive absenteeism</li><li>Rapid turnover and associated recruitment and training costs</li><li>Reputational damage that impacts both recruitment and sales</li><li>Legal costs and risk of workers&#8217; compensation claims</li><li>Eroded workplace culture making theft and other corporate crimes more likely</li></ul>



<p><strong>Turn the Tide With Corporate Investigations and Corporate Culture Audits</strong></p>



<p>When someone makes a workplace harassment complaint, you can quickly and efficiently <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/harassment-discrimination/">bring in a skilled investigator</a>, reveal the truth of the matter, and get things back on track. However, what if this kind of misconduct is taking place under the radar? No employer is all-seeing and all-knowing. This makes a Corporate Culture Audit an immensely valuable resource to have in your toolkit.</p>



<p>This wellness check-up for your organization will take the lid off any and all issues that may be impacting your path towards prosperity—from workplace harassment to organizational silos, and many more besides. Lauth Investigations International draws on decades of experience within the corporate field, helping businesses forge a route towards excellence through effective investigative services.

<p>It might be easy to think, “that would never happen in <em>my</em> business,” but workplace harassment is an issue that traverses all industries, all working environments, and all sizes of organization. Ranging from workplace bullying, to sexual harassment, through to outright discrimination, this particular problem can be one of many faces, and the signs aren&#8217;t always obvious. Would you know which indicators to look out for?</p>



<p>But surely, if workplace harassment took place on your premises or within the teams under your command, someone would speak up—right? Sadly, research indicates that <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/10/15/16438750/weinstein-sexual-harassment-facts">75% of incidents go unreported</a>. With these factors in mind, it is crucial to be familiar with a spectrum of signs that could let you know that a hostile workplace environment is beginning to take hold. So let&#8217;s dig into the facts. Read on as we reveal the red flags that can serve as signals that workplace harassment may be taking place, and what you can do about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Is Workplace Harassment?</strong></h3>



<p>Because verbal and psychological workplace harassment don&#8217;t leave a mark or a trail, victims often feel uncomfortable and confused about whether reporting their experiences is a good idea, or even afraid of retaliation if they do. Of course, that fear becomes all the more palpable when physical or sexual harassment are taking place.<br></p>



<p>In terms of who may be impacted—or who may be the harasser—it&#8217;s important to remember that this type of interaction is not always relegated to superior/subordinate working relationships. Workplace harassment may cross teams, with the harasser working in a role above, below, or even unconnected to the victim. Particular forms of misconduct could include slurs, name-calling, offensive jokes, intimidation, insults, ridicule, or work disruption—and these may take place in person, or within the digital realm, otherwise known as “cyber bullying.”</p>



<p><br>The reality is that all forms of of workplace harassment are not only illegal, but also guaranteed to leave a sizable hole in your bottom line. When any form of harassment at work is tolerated, you can anticipate a drop in productivity and a surge in turnover as employees&#8217; sense of safety and camaraderie is eroded. Not to mention, the very real risk of litigation will also be looming.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Are the Signs of Workplace Harassment?</strong></h3>



<p>The most obvious indicator that some form of workplace bullying, discrimination, or sexual harassment may be taking place is of course a complaint. These should always be followed by immediate and <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-investigations/">strategic corporate investigations</a>. However, when incidents go unreported, you can safeguard employees by remaining alert to the following signs:<br></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Behavioral Changes</strong><br>If you notice a sudden change in an employee&#8217;s behavior—perhaps with them becoming more withdrawn and avoidant of corporate events or meetings—then a check-in is advisable.</li><li><strong>Performance Changes</strong><strong><br></strong>An employee who starts missing deadlines, struggling to focus, or performing to a lower standard may be struggling with the burden of workplace harassment.</li><li><strong>Atmosphere Changes</strong><br>While only one individual may be the direct victim of workplace harassment, the rest of your team may also be bearing the brunt of its occurrence. A disintegration in communication, rising tensions, and higher turnover may all be red flags.</li><li><strong>Attendance Changes</strong><strong><br></strong>The experience of being harassed or witnessing harassment can be both stressful and traumatizing. This may lead a once-punctual employee to begin arriving late, missing important events, or increasingly calling in sick.</li></ul>

<p>We all like to think that every one of our employees or co-workers is guided by a strong moral compass and is conducting themselves accordingly. In some instances, we might even imagine that a little office banter with sexual undertones is harmless, but the reality is that when no clear line is drawn on what constitutes sexual harassment in the workplace, a slippery slope is often established in its place.</p>



<p>Sexual misconduct of any kind can lead to pervasive distress, loss of productivity, and ultimately loss of talent—as a toxic working environment leads precious innovators to look for healthier work environments elsewhere. Employers should also recognize that receiving one sexual harassment complaint may mean gaining oversight on what is ultimately only the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>The reality is that while 81% of women <a href="https://whattobecome.com/blog/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-statistics/">have experienced</a> some form of sexual harassment in their lifetime, 58% of those who were harassed at work don&#8217;t file a complaint for fear of factors such as retaliation or disbelief. According to data gathered confidentially by Stop Street Harassment, as many of 43% of men have also experienced some sort of sexual harassment—so there&#8217;s no escaping that this is a problem that can impact anyone, and is ultimately one that we often don&#8217;t get a true sense of.</p>



<p>When it comes to receiving a formal complaint and gearing up ahead of investigating sexual harassment or sexual misconduct in the workplace, there&#8217;s a lot to navigate. On behalf of both the victim and the alleged perpetrator, responsibility in regard to physical and mental health, privacy, and legal rights all land in the hand of the employer. Meanwhile, for the organization itself, risk of retaliation, liability, and reputational damage hang in the balance. That makes what happens next something that must ready to stand up to scrutiny.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turn to Corporate Investigations Services When Handling Sexual Harassment in the Workplace</strong></h3>



<p>With so much at stake, investigating sexual harassment or misconduct means building a case that cannot be left open to any perception of bias. If a complaint should evolve towards litigation, an employer&#8217;s failure to fully undertake and document an impartial corporate investigation, <em>or</em> it&#8217;s failure to act decisively upon any complaint received may well end in liability. Information gathered might later become admissible in court proceedings, while a poorly judged step may damage the credibility of evidence. This makes turning to an external investigator the best way to safeguard the interests of both the organization and the individuals involved.</p>



<p>Hiring a private investigator with a proven track record for corporate investigations of this nature also means lifting the emotional burden of investigating a colleague—under what may be distressing circumstances—from your HR or leadership team. A professional who is seasoned at investigating sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace will not only be adept at discreetly and efficiently gathering the information necessary, but they will also be able to advise on every investigatory and reporting step from a legal standpoint, guaranteeing due process and exemplary action along the way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Opportunity to Be an Industry Leader in the Prevention of Sexual Harassment in the Workplace</strong></h3>



<p>While the occurrence of a sexual misconduct complaint may well leave any organization anxious about what lies ahead, choosing to step ahead of this issue is an action that can only be rewarded. Since the #metoo movement arrived, attitudes towards sexual harassment in the workplace have evolved, with 99% of employees <a href="https://whattobecome.com/blog/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace-statistics/">successfully recognizing</a> sexual harassment situations, and the vast majority supporting the fight against this type of workplace misconduct.</p>



<p>While this new era has created an environment in which many feel more able to speak up, statistics tell us that it is also in fact driving <em>down</em> incidents of sexual harassment in the workplace, with EEOC actually reporting a drop from 2020 to 2021. This tells us that setting clear policies and demonstrating a safe environment for employees is a worthy pursuit. Of course, this is a transformation still in its inception—HRAcuity reports that only 15% of companies are on the case. Are you ready to establish your brand as one who lives by values that everyone can believe in?<br><br>Alongside outlining clear and easily understood company policies and delivering training across every employee tear, organizations are increasingly turning to <a href="about:blank">corporate culture audits</a> as a health-check for issues ranging from <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/harassment-discrimination/">sexual harassment to discrimination</a>, and even <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-investigations/">corporate theft and white collar crime</a>.<br>Taking this proactive step means getting ahead of problems before they manifest into costly or damaging incidents that warrant corporate investigations, litigation, or substantial losses. Better yet, it means forging and sustaining a thriving workplace environment in which employees can grow, flourish, and drive the bottom line. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about corporate investigation services in relation to sexual harassment in the workplace—or the phenomenal results that corporate culture audits can yield—<a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/contact-lauth-investigations/">the team at Lauth Investigations</a> are ready to take your call.</p>
