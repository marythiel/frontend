<p>Corporations and nonprofits are in mutual company in 2020 as new rules and regulations of corporation oversight and employment go into effect. Leadership will have to step up their administrative supervision of their internal processes to ensure they don’t violate new legislature. Luckily, hiring a private investigator to ensure your company is compliant with new administrative legislature at the fraction of a cost to expand your corporation’s <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/05/internal-teams-vs-private-investigators/">internal investigation team. </a></p>



<p><strong><a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/11/sexual-harassment-corporate-culture-audits/">Sexual Harassment Prevention</a></strong></p>



<p>Legislature and leadership alike are refocusing their personnel priorities to push sexual harassment to the forefront of their reform. In addition to ratcheting up sexual harassment prevention, but all forms of harassment within their workplace. <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/Employment-and-HR/894160/NLRB-Issues-Several-Employer-Friendly-Decisions">A recent NLRB decision</a> that would allow leadership to enforce total confidentiality during internal investigation, which will assist the identification of predators within any workforce. Private investigators are ideal candidates to seek out the predator in any corporation or organization, because they can infiltrate the workforce under the radar and collect evidence and testimony that might otherwise be lost. </p>



<p><strong>Immigration, Worksite Enforcement &amp; Background Screening</strong></p>



<p>Employers can look forward to the United States Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) increasing oversight on work sites, evaluating hiring
processes, and ensuring every employee is able to legally work in the United
States. Employers who do not comply will be subject to both civil and criminal
penalties that can be devastating to an organization. Private investigators
have vast databases at their disposal to obtain work and residency records for
potential hire, applying proven screening methods to ensure no personnel are a
legal liability. </p>



<p><strong>Independent Contractors </strong></p>



<p>Legislature is also holding companies to a higher standard of responsibility when their independent or sub-contractors incur legal trouble or have grievances against the parent organization. A bill in California known as AB 5 would make it more difficult to classify a worker as an independent or sub-contractor, a measure that would effect employers both in California and throughout the nation. When contractors are successfully classified as such, you’ll need a private investigator on your side to comprehensively vet the situation. With their full investigative toolbox, private investigators can get to the truth about inciting events that led to legal action, collecting evidence, speaking to worksite foremen, and provide comprehensive solutions to employers. </p>



<p><strong>Overtime </strong></p>



<p>Private investigators can also lend their prowess to individuals who
believe a corporation is misappropriating funds in order to comply with a
Department of Labor measure that requires employers to pay a minimum percentage
of total salary in order to satisfy overtime requirements. Private
investigators who specialize in financial fraud and misappropriation are able
to review a corporation’s internal processes and open-source financial records
to document the appropriation of overtime pay. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/05/5-cyber-security-measures-every-business/">Data Privacy</a></strong></p>



<p>With
the ubiquity of technology and digital communication systems, corporate data—especially
with regard to transparency—is a trending issue in public discourse. Whether
through legal channels or otherwise, corporations and organizations need to
protect their data from falling into the wrong hands. A private investigator
can provide any organization with a risk assessment of both their digital and
brick-and-mortar security measures from top to bottom—identifying cracks in the
system and providing expert recommendations to ensure internal information
stays internal. Private investigators can also identify potential
whistleblowers in a workforce by examining individual risk factors and patterns
of behavior. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s mind-boggling to think that some of the most controversial scandals in our country’s history have taken place only in the last decade. Corporate scandal is a hot media item, with the misbehavior of employees at all levels facing public scrutiny.  <a href="https://chiefexecutive.net/how-to-conduct-a-quality-internal-investigation/">Information on corporations and their corporate culture</a> is more visible than ever as experts continue to place more and more importance on work-life balance, and satisfaction in the workplace remaining the driving force behind employee engagement. As technology and the ubiquity of accessible information continues to advance, private United States citizens are becoming more informed about the largest corporations in the nation, how their behavior effects their corporate footprint, and how their own consumerism can affect these corporations. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">BP Oil Spil </h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/deepwater_horizon_BP_oil_rig_gulf_of_mexico_collapse-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2214" width="370" height="277"/></figure></div>



<p>There’s no better place to start than at the beginning. In April of 2010, the oil and gas conglomerate BP began the new decade with an oil spill so catastrophic that we’re still talking about the environmental impact ten years later. The corporate scandal also involved devastating loss. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, which broke open the will, dumping between 2.5 and 4.2 million barrels of oil into the gulf before it could be capped once more. For thousands of miles, the oil slicks contributed to the deterioration of marine life and had cost the corporation in excess of $65 billion dollars before 2020. In an article published in June of 2010, Peter Fairly of MIT Technology stated, “A culture of tighter safety and more experienced regulators might have prevented the BP Deepwater Horizon leak.” Under the terms of a settlement, BP agreed to pay the Natural Resource Damage Asessment Trustees up to $8.8 billion for restoration work to rebuild the natural environment that was damaged by the spill. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Foxconn Suicides</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/360_foxconn_0525.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2219" width="262" height="171"/></figure></div>



<p>Later in 2010, there was an alarming string of suicides at a plant run by Foxconn, a Chinese corporation that produces roughly 40% of the world’s consumer electronic components—technology that builds our smartphones, gaming consoles, and other forms of smart technology. These tragedies were covered heavily in American media as questions arose to the quality of labor conditions in these Chinese plants. In subsequent investigations, it was revealed that workers could be working 12-hour shifts, with less than a dollar (U.S.) in their pocket for food. While the suicides received a great deal of coverage, and had public relations repercussions for corporations that utilize Foxconn exports, there have been at least 8 additional suicides at the same factor have been reported since 2010. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FIFA Corruption</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/141219143522-sepp-story-top.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2222" width="338" height="189"/></figure></div>



<p>Few things are more universally loved across the globe than soccer, or football, as it’s known in the rest of the world. In May of 2015, millions of soccer fans were shaken by the FIFA corruption corporate scandal. The Department of Justice indicted the Federation Internationale de Football Association leadership on charges of racketeering, wire fraud, and money-laundering. The indictment outlined various instances of an excess of $15 million dollars in bribes taken by executives for preserving advertisement marketing rights for decades. The scandal lead to the resignation of President Sepp Blatter in June of 2015 after he managed to escape indictment. Millions of dollars in legal costs and loss of corporate sponsorship severely damaged the reputation of the organization, netting losses of $122.4 million. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theranos &amp; Elizabeth Holmes </h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/974_main.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2229"/></figure></div>



<p>The scandal surrounding the health technology company known as Theranos was a cluster 15 years in the making. Once again a corporate scandal that effected public health, both the executive and the corporation were villified in the media. Stemming from a fear of needles when she was a child, founder Elizabeth Holmes was seeking to develop a technology that would lead to higher accessibility of blood-testing throughout the world. Her device supposedly would be able to perform a smattering of biological tests from a single drop of blood. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> published an expose in October of 2015, exposing more of the company’s deception and further implicating some of Holmes’ colleagues in the scandal. Holmes was charged with massive fraud in March 2018. Formerly thought of as a young genius, she is scheduled to stand trial in 2020, facing up to 20 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Big Pharma &amp; the Opioid Crisis</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/opioids_smartstock_istock_thinkstock2.jpg" alt="Corporate Scandals " class="wp-image-2231"/></figure></div>



<p>Corporate scandal is at it&#8217;s worst when it comes to public health. The ever-growing opioid crisis in the United States is hands down one of the most pervasive scandals of the last decade. In 2017 alone, there were over 70,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States. Of those overdose deaths, 67% came from an overdose of opioids. From the Midwest to the Northeast, opioid deaths spiked between 2016 and 2017. As of November 2019, six pharmaceutical companies were under federal investigation and were facing federal charges for their responsibility for the opioid crisis. Amongst other big pharma companies, Purdue Pharma reached settled for billions of dollars for communities in 23 states that were affected by their shipment of opioids, forcing the company to ultimately filing for bankruptcy. The settlement set major precedent as the first of it’s kind in our American legal system. </p>
