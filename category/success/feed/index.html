										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Private investigators at Lauth Investigations International were contracted by an adjuster in Indianapolis to ascertain if a claimant was falsifying his work-related injuries for an extended vacation. The individual presented a diagnosis from his local chiropractor indicating he was suffering from chronic lower back and recurring neck pain, yet statements from the individual&#8217;s neighbor revealed the veracity of his injuries were disputable. After 12 hours of surveillance activities at the claimant&#8217;s residence, the assigned insurance investigator discovered the man was able to tolerate his claimed suffering well enough to clean the household pool, rake fallen leaves, and without struggle, carry 13 heavy leaf bags to the end of the driveway for trash pickup. The adjuster was able to make a quick resolution after investigators provided video and a comprehensive written report to close the worker&#8217;s compensation claim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lauth Investigations International conducted the death investigation of a 17-year-old. According to police, the teen had been murdered by his brother, but that seemed unlikely because the deceased teen&#8217;s brother was confined to a wheelchair at the time of the teen&#8217;s death. Lauth investigators, who specialize in death investigations, were able to obtain evidence showing that the 17-year-old committed suicide. The cause of death was determined and based upon a vital witness statement taken from the nephew of the victim, whom the police had never interviewed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, a local insurance company asked their special investigations unit to locate a primary witness on an accident case. Their attempts included accessing several databases with the social security number and date of birth. Upon hiring Lauth Investigations International, private investigators found that the subject had been using the nickname &#8220;Little Man&#8221; and his true name was an alias. Investigators then traveled to the accident scene and interviewed several individuals that commonly loiter at the corner. Using the description of the primary witness using the nickname Little Man when questioning the individuals at the accident location, they provided Lauth investigators with an approximate location of the primary witness. Traveling to the location and physically knocking on several doors, a neighbor pointed investigators to a home determined to be the mother of the witness who was only 17 years-old. With the mother&#8217;s cooperation, a telephone statement was obtained by the teen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A local law firm retained Lauth Investigations skilled private investigators to assist in a child endangerment case. The clients were the grandparents of two children that were living with their mother and her boyfriend. The objective of the investigation was to impeach the credibility of the mother because of suspicions of drug use and high traffic at the mother&#8217;s residence. Short-term human surveillance video documented extremely high traffic frequency at the apartment. In addition, surveillance uncovered that the mother and boyfriend had been leaving the children with neighbors and strangers who were unknown to the grandparents. Lauth&#8217;s private investigators also conducted a background check of the live-in boyfriend and discovered numerous disturbance reports, altercations with neighbors, and police incident reports of domestic violence witnessed by the children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lauth Investigations International was retained by the Fortune 500 Company Pepsi-Co Inc. to uncover suspicions of a driver who for several months was allegedly stocking too much inventory in his truck. For nearly two weeks, Lauth Investigations conducted vehicular surveillance of the subject using two vehicles to determine what days and times the increased inventory was being dropped. As a result, investigators obtained over one hour of video surveillance of the suspected employee meeting with a few locals unloading and transferring nearly 2 tons of Pepsi from an immobile standby and daily truck to a large Ryder semi-trailer. Later, three employees were prosecuted for theft and receiving stolen goods, including some of the locals that assisted the employees in transportation of the stolen property.</p>
