<p>Financial fraud – two words that strike fear into the hearts of individuals and businesses alike. In today&#8217;s world, where digital transactions and complex financial systems reign supreme, the risk of falling victim to fraudulent activities is higher than ever. From identity theft and credit card fraud to elaborate Ponzi schemes and insider trading, the tactics employed by fraudsters are as diverse as they are deceptive. But fear not, for in this article, we will delve deep into the realm of <a href="https://lauthinvestigations.com/fraud-forgery/">financial fraud</a> prevention, exploring strategies that individuals and businesses can implement to safeguard their assets and mitigate risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Landscape of Financial Fraud</h2>



<p>Before we dive into prevention strategies, let&#8217;s take a moment to understand the landscape of financial fraud. In recent years, the prevalence of cyber crime has skyrocketed, with hackers and scammers employing sophisticated tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in digital systems. Phishing emails, malware attacks, and data breaches are just a few examples of the techniques used by cyber criminals to gain access to sensitive information and perpetrate fraud.</p>



<p>In addition to cyber crime, traditional forms of fraud such as identity theft and embezzlement continue to pose significant threats to individuals and businesses. Whether it&#8217;s a dishonest employee skimming funds from company accounts or a fraudster using stolen personal information to open fraudulent credit accounts, the impact of financial fraud can be devastating, both financially and emotionally.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Strategies for Individuals</h2>



<p>Now that we have a better understanding of the risks associated with financial fraud, let&#8217;s explore some strategies that individuals can employ to protect themselves against falling victim to fraudulent activities.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Monitor Financial Accounts Regularly</strong>: One of the most effective ways to detect and prevent fraud is to monitor your financial accounts regularly. Keep a close eye on your bank statements, credit card transactions, and credit reports for any suspicious activity. If you notice any unauthorized charges or unfamiliar accounts, report them to your financial institution immediately.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Use Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication</strong>: Protect your online accounts by using strong, unique passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it more difficult for fraudsters to gain access to your accounts.</li>



<li><strong>Be Wary of Phishing Attempts</strong>: Phishing emails are a common tactic used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or financial details. Be cautious of unsolicited emails or messages asking for personal information, and never click on links or download attachments from unknown senders.</li>



<li><strong>Shred Sensitive Documents</strong>: Dispose of sensitive documents such as bank statements, credit card bills, and tax forms securely by shredding them before throwing them away. This helps prevent identity thieves from rummaging through your trash and stealing your personal information.</li>



<li><strong>Stay Informed</strong>: Educate yourself about the latest scams and fraud trends so that you can recognize potential threats and take appropriate action to protect yourself. Stay up-to-date on news and information from reputable sources, and don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to your financial institution or law enforcement if you suspect fraudulent activity.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Strategies for Businesses</h2>



<p>In addition to individuals, businesses also face significant risks when it comes to financial fraud. From employee theft and vendor fraud to sophisticated cyberattacks, the potential for loss is substantial. Here are some strategies that businesses can implement to prevent financial fraud:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&nbsp;<strong>Implement Strong Internal Controls</strong>: Establish robust internal controls and procedures to safeguard your company&#8217;s assets and detect fraudulent activity. This may include segregation of duties, regular audits, and strict approval processes for financial transactions.</li>



<li><strong>Conduct Background Checks</strong>: Before hiring new employees or engaging with vendors and contractors, conduct thorough background checks to verify their credentials and ensure they have a clean record. This can help prevent hiring individuals with a history of fraud or dishonesty.</li>



<li><strong>Provide Ongoing Training</strong>: Educate your employees about the risks of financial fraud and provide training on how to recognize and report suspicious activity. Encourage a culture of transparency and accountability, where employees feel comfortable speaking up if they suspect fraudulent behavior.</li>



<li>&nbsp;<strong>Secure Your Digital Systems</strong>: Invest in robust cybersecurity measures to protect your company&#8217;s sensitive information from cyberattacks. This may include firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and regular security updates.</li>



<li><strong>Monitor Financial Transactions</strong>: Keep a close eye on your company&#8217;s financial transactions and accounts, and regularly reconcile accounts to detect any discrepancies or irregularities. Implement automated monitoring systems to flag suspicious activity in real-time.</li>
</ul>

<p>In today&#8217;s hyperconnected world, safeguarding your business from pervasive workplace theft and fraud is inevitable, and demands a multifaceted approach. Enterprises are increasingly grappling with the metamorphosis of criminal tactics and the advancement of technology. These trends are a danger to any surviving business and require well-thought-out approaches to mitigate losses. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), organizations lose about 5% of their total revenue through fraud, which amounts to trillion dollars annually. This loss goes beyond financial, to damage of trust by customers, dented reputation, and legal ramifications.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure your workplace is protected from these threats, it is paramount to institute solid strategies that address vulnerabilities across the business- policies, employee awareness, organization culture, and policies. Let&#8217;s delve into methods that you can employ to prevent theft and fraud in your industry.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Culture of Integrity</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is essential to understand that a business is as good as its employees. This means that if the workforce is morally corrupted, this is reflected in your business, and the chances of making losses are high. Cultivating a culture of integrity is the foundation of dealing with fraud, and this has been supported by past research showing that institutions with high integrity culture experience less fraud. Does this resonate with you? Well, let&#8217;s look at the case of Wells Fargo, a financial institution embroiled in a scandal of fraudulent account openings. Due to the aggressive sales culture of the company, it incentivized employees to achieve unrealistic targets. This misconduct of wanting to achieve short-term gains damaged the company&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>A simple act of failing to act ethically can ruin your years of investment, a pitfall that businesses should avoid. This can happen by supporting workforce accountability, transparency, and honesty. As a human resource director, you are responsible for encouraging an open form of communication where employees can report any theft or fraudulent activities without fear. For you to effectively implement these, it is essential that you understand the nature of your corporate culture, and Lauth has seasoned experts in conducting corporate culture audits. We will ensure that the findings of the audit capture the weaknesses and provide workable recommendations.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting Thorough Background Checks</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Trust but verify.&#8221; This adage should prevail when hiring new employees. Conducting a thorough background check is vital in identifying the red flags and mitigating the risk. The data released by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) alludes that about one-third of job applicants provide false information on their resumes. This should scare you as a human resource director. Consider the Enron Energy Company case, deemed one of the heinous accounting frauds in history that led to its demise. If the company had conducted proper background checks on the executive, they might have uncovered the unethical behavior.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:image {"id":165934,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="908" height="438" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2.png" alt="Background checks at the workplace" class="wp-image-165934" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2.png 908w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2-480x232.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 908px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The rule of thumb is a background check is essential to prevent internal fraud and theft, which could potentially cripple your business. Most human resource directors need to pay more attention to this stage, as it is perceived to waste time. It&#8217;s understandable, but we must find a way to dispel the fact that such a process can be outsourced. Our private investigators are experienced in conducting comprehensive background checks and providing objective details that would save your company in the future.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Stringent Access Controls</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>We must uphold the importance of securing business&#8217;s information and critical data. Insider threats account for a high percentage of fraud incidents, emphasizing the significance of having strong access control. To avoid data breaches, it is imperative to implement pin codes, biometric scanners, and keycards since they are important tools for identifying and monitoring the activities of employees within the place of work.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Are all these stringent measures effective? The answer to this question might differ depending on whether your business has experienced a case of fraud or theft. However, it has been proven that establishing access control at the cash office prevents theft. This is because all log trails are left behind, and any theft can be traced to a specific employee. You need to know the source to mitigate. That&#8217;s why the fraud investigation service is elemental for your company.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Surveillance and Monitoring Systems</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Deploying surveillance cameras and monitoring systems could be a step towards mitigating theft and fraud in the workplace. While it might intimidate the workers, it is a security awareness strategy. The study conducted by the University of North Carolina showed that cameras reduce theft and fraud by 51%. For example, in the retail sector, video analytics software can detect activities such as shoplifting and provide real-time information to security personnel to act. Now that our most excellent tool at Lauth is risk assessment, we can offer guidelines on where you could be missing regarding surveillance and monitoring. Secure your investment!</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Safeguarding your business against theft and fraud needs a comprehensive approach, requiring you to examine your organization&#8217;s culture, existing policies, available technology, and employees&#8217; awareness. Organizations can curb theft and fraud by implementing a culture of integrity, conducting background checks, implementing access control, and ensuring surveillance and monitoring systems. These protect your reputation and assets and uphold the culture of accountability. Lauth&#8217;s investigative services chip in to supplement your organization’s operational safety.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-6266663-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-160975" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-6266663-980x653.jpg 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-6266663-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p>Employee fraud is common, especially in small and medium-sized businesses. It involves fraudulent activities such as stealing from your organization, deceiving your employer, or illegally gaining financial favor or personal benefits. According to one study, about 46% of organizations have admitted to experiencing fraud in the last two years. While fraud can stem from other sources like shareholders, business partners, or service providers, most fraud threats are internal rather than external.  This is why it is crucial to know a fraud red flag when you see it. </p>



<p>Employee fraud can take several forms, but the most common ones include payroll fraud, embezzlement, theft, and bribery. While it can sometimes be hard to detect cases of employee fraud, there are certain fraud red flags to look for. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A sudden change in an employee&#8217;s lifestyle that doesn&#8217;t match their salary or benefits. For example, you should consider doing workplace investigations if some junior employees suddenly acquire costly houses and cars.</li>



<li>Employees suddenly become secretive and unwilling to share their processes with anyone, not even their bosses. Consider it a fraud red flag if an employee is reluctant to let a third party review their processes and procedures because the chances they are doing something they weren&#8217;t supposed to do are high.</li>



<li>You keep receiving tips or complaints that a particular employee indulges in fraud. If this happens, you need to commence <strong>workplace investigations</strong> immediately to get to the root of the matter. After all, there are indications that up to 42% of employee fraud cases are detected thanks to tips from known and anonymous sources.</li>



<li>Sudden inconsistencies in accounts. For example, sudden, excessive, and unexplainable cash transactions could indicate fraud. Be ready to get auditors to look into your organization&#8217;s account to check for discrepancies. </li>



<li>An employee suddenly thinks he is above the laws of the organization, and the rules do not apply to him. Once you notice this, the next logical thing is to get your internal control team on board to begin thorough investigations. Refraining from following proper procedures or adhering to the regulations of your organization is a huge fraud red flag. </li>
</ul>



<p>You must prevent your organization from fraud as a business owner or manager. So once you notice signs of fraud, you must invest in a thorough <strong>workplace investigation</strong> to uncover all the criminals and prevent further crimes. Of course, different organizations and institution have their procedures and processes for <strong>conducting employee investigations</strong>, but these steps can help prevent fraud in your business.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Plan the investigation thoroughly</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Even if you want to investigate a particular fraudulent activity, you must ensure that your investigations have a long-term effect in curbing fraud. This is why it is crucial to plan before delving into the investigations. First of all, you have to choose a great team of investigators who are knowledgeable of your state&#8217;s laws and have a certain level of integrity, but you must ensure these investigators are on the same page with you and share your goals, methods, and deadlines.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Review your records carefully</strong>.</p>



<p>You can gather much evidence through workplace or employee investigation interviews. There is also a great deal of hard possible evidence to comb through, such as videos, records, photos, emails, or documents. Take your time to review these documents carefully to arrive at accurate conclusions. You may also review the personal file of the suspect, including their period of unused leave, whether or not they are logging in and out of the company&#8217;s accounts at odd hours, and if there have been any declines in their performance. When you take time to gather information and review it carefully, you not only arrive at an accurate conclusion on the case at hand but also open your eyes to see more loopholes so you can modify your processes to avoid the same or similar fraudulent acts.  </p>



<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Analyze your evidence accurately</strong>.</p>



<p>It is one thing to get evidence during a fraudulent activity investigation and another to analyze them accurately. This is why narrowing your analyses to concrete, specific, authentic, and relevant evidence for the <strong>workplace investigation</strong> is imperative. Also, you would save time and energy if you learn to separate facts from opinions. Your goal in a fraud investigation is to prove or disprove an allegation, so you must ensure that the evidence you focus on matches the allegations. However, thoroughly analyzing your evidence will help you arrive at an accurate conclusion, which could discourage other employees from fraud.</p>



<p>4.      <strong>Drawing conclusions &amp; making decisions</strong>.</p>



<p>It is imperative to make decisions once you have concluded the investigation. Your decision could involve terminating the contracts of guilty employees, sending them on punitive transfers, or handing them over to law enforcement if their crimes are punishable. Again, such decisions will deter others from indulging in fraudulent activities. By the end of the <strong>corporate investigation,</strong> you would be able to identify all the weaknesses in your procedures, systems, and policies. </p>

<p>Your business is your livelihood. It&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve poured your blood, sweat, and tears into establishing. So it can be very devastating to suddenly find out that your accountant has run away with your company&#8217;s money. You can actually feel like a rug has been pulled out from under you.</p>



<p>Accountants can steal money for many reasons, including lack of internal control, poor salaries, and obsolete technologies. This is why it&#8217;s imperative to always invest in your business by adopting the most appropriate technologies and motivating your workers through attractive salaries and other benefits. Nonetheless, some accountants steal for reasons beyond your control, such as greed. Unfortunately, you can do little or nothing to cure greedy employees.</p>



<p>There are, however, many ways through which accounts can steal money from your business. But then, stealing is mainly made through white-collar crimes like money laundering and embezzlement. Of course, some accountants can also steal huge amounts of money within the business premises. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to get your business back up and running with the help of professionals. Here is what you need to do;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Notify law enforcement authorities.</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The first thing to do upon realizing your accountant has run off with your money is to notify the law enforcement authorities of your country. Give them details, including the accountant&#8217;s name, how much you think he ran off with, and the last time he was seen within your business premises. This step is crucial as law enforcement would do everything possible to track down the suspect early enough to recover all or part of your money before serving justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Employ a new accountant</strong></p>



<p>The role of an accountant in every business can never be overemphasized. Accountants play the crucial role of making critical financial decisions by collecting, tracking, and correcting the organization&#8217;s financial decisions. So, once you&#8217;ve notified authorities, you will need to recruit another competent accountant to take over from the one who ran away with your money. While at it, remember to do a background check on the most eligible candidates before making a final decision. This is to help you not fall into the hands of another white-collar criminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, suddenly recruiting an accountant can be difficult and stressful, but it&#8217;s essential to getting your business back on track. If you find it too overwhelming to recruit a new accountant, you can hire the services of professional recruiters to help you get a reliable and competent person to fill in the gap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Review your financial records</strong></p>



<p>You also need to review your financial records carefully to ensure all your money is accounted for. A thorough review will help you know exactly how much your ex-accountant must have stolen from you. However, hiring professional auditors for a detailed financial review is advisable. The reason is that professionals will carefully review your business and identify all those areas where your accountant may have stolen from you. Also, professional auditors will give you a better understanding of your financial situation, which will help you make informed decisions on how to sustain your business and prevent it from shutting down.</p>



<p><strong>4.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Make changes to your accounting procedures</strong></p>



<p>It also makes sense to modify, update or change your accounting procedures to prevent such problems. Of course, such changes don&#8217;t just end with hiring a new accountant, as you could also implement new and more sophisticated accounting software that helps you stay on track with the activities of your accountant. Also, you could make changes to your internal accounting procedures. For example, you could limit access to only authorized personnel in interior areas such as storage areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Get help from other professionals</strong></p>



<p>Dealing with the aftermath of your accountant running off with your money can be a daunting task. Fortunately, many professionals can help you through this challenging phase. For example, you can hire a lawyer or a professional investigator to cooperate with law enforcement to track and punish the criminal. Also, you could employ another professional accountant to review your financial records, identify areas where you may be vulnerable, and make changes to your accounting procedures. Similarly, you could hire professional business analysts and developers to help identify other business opportunities that could improve your organization&#8217;s finances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you have adequate measures in place to protect yourself from the perils of small business fraud, embezzlement, and workplace theft? Far too many businesses don&#8217;t realize that the biggest threat to their success is usually standing next to them. In fact, in the world of enterprise, <a href="https://community.mis.temple.edu/tkaye/files/2017/08/RMI-2901-Part-2-submission.pdf">90% of all significant theft losses</a> come from employees. If that isn&#8217;t enough to alarm you, know that those losses lead to <a href="https://www.smg.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/resources/are-happier-employees-less-likely-to-steal.pdf?sfvrsn=c356c331_8">more than 30% of business bankruptcies</a>. Investing in preventative measures could represent the best dollar spend you ever make on behalf of your business.</p>



<p>It can feel unnerving to imagine that the biggest threat to any organization usually lurks within, but there are actually numerous rock-solid small business fraud and theft prevention strategies that anyone can roll out fairly simply. Here at Lauth Investigation International, we are proud to provide various large and small business risk assessments, culture audits, employee screening services, and corporate investigations to all in their moments of need. But first, let&#8217;s explore what you can do today to protect your business against employees who are anything but team players.</p>



<p><strong>Beef-Up Your On-Site Security Protocols</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes, the physical vulnerabilities of any business are due to a lack of security hardware such as locking doors and CCTV cameras. But at others, they are as simple as managers having gotten sloppy about cash or inventory handling procedures or a lack of strategy when it comes to separation of duties and asset access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, certain employees have become so much a part of the furniture that they are given free rein to ramp up your risks—intentionally or otherwise. Overhauling common practices, policies, and daily procedures can bring such glaring oversights back into view. If in doubt, an <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/threat-violence-assessment/">expert risk and threat assessment</a> can be the best way to make sure that every security hole is firmly plugged.</p>



<p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Background Checks When Hiring</strong></p>



<p>Research has revealed that as many as <a href="https://www.hireright.com/news/press-release/10th-annual-hireright-benchmark-survey-finds-48-percent-of-employers-do-not">85% percent of employers</a> have uncovered a lie or misrepresentation on a candidate&#8217;s resume. Some of these deceptions will have been illuminated by background checks, but others will have only come to light when the employee in question revealed their true nature—potentially doing substantial damage in the process. The best way to eliminate bad actors from your workplace is to refuse them entry, and choosing to conduct <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/background-checks/">comprehensive background checks</a> is the best way to achieve this. </p>



<p><strong>Be Dutiful About Digital and Financial Safeguards</strong></p>



<p>These days, everything that happens within your business leaves a trail—and that reality can be your greatest asset in mitigating risk or it can be an exposed Achilles tendon. The data that is precious to you—whether trade secrets or customer payment details—should always be indulged with the latest cyber security tools and web safety awareness training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, access to financial and inventory records should be tightly controlled while every cent on the dollar is accounted for. Make daily deposits and conduct monthly checks to ensure that everything is in order. Access to both assets and the records of them should be need-to-see only, removing temptation from the get-go.</p>



<p><strong>Keep Your Corporate Culture House Clean</strong></p>



<p>If a stranger walked in off the street today and asked your employees how they feel about the place and you as their employer, what do you think they&#8217;d say? Corporate culture is a measure of the morale, shared values, and collective goals of any team. When this distinct workplace culture falls into ill health, employees soon stop caring about the wellbeing of the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some may feel empowered or even justified to commit fraud, embezzlement, or workplace theft, while others will simply turn a disinterested blind eye. So, is your corporate culture fighting fit or in need of a trip to the hospital? A <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-culture-audit/">Corporate Culture Audit</a> will reveal all of this and more.<br>Hopefully, these pointers will help you make great strides in protecting your business against internal threats. However, if you feel you&#8217;d benefit from additional support, the team at Lauth Investigations International has your back. From employee screening to corporate investigations, our full-spectrum and tailored services offer all the resources you need to keep your business thriving. <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/contact-lauth-investigations/">Get in touch today to find out more</a></p>

<p>When it comes to protecting your business from the myriad of frauds that occur in U.S. workplaces every single day, being informed is the first step. Our private investigators are here to help you recognize these top five types of fraud in business so they can be stopped as soon as possible.  </p>



<p>Payroll Fraud &nbsp;</p>



<p>Payroll fraud is one of the top five types of fraud that are seen the most often in businesses of all sizes but particularly small businesses. It also takes many different forms, such as employees lying about productivity, payment advances, or manipulation of timeclock records. As such, those records should be carefully monitored and all potential employees should be thoroughly screened before onboarding. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Asset Misappropriation &nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, asset misappropriation is one of the top five types of fraud that is the easiest to spot. Missing assets are going to be noticed. Most managers and supervisors keep tabs on asset misappropriation by rotating out staff who are in charge of supervising inventory or cash kept on hand. It’s also crucial that any accounting positions are not singular, and finances are managed by more than one person. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Invoice Fraud Schemes &nbsp;</p>



<p>This type of fraud is a bit more complicated, and usually involves an employee who works in accounting. It’s achieved by generating fake or inflated invoices for purposes of stealing money from the company. These invoices may detail products that were never sold, vendors who do not exist, or B2B transactions that never took place. To avoid this, all invoices must be cross-referenced with inventory or performed work that is documented.  </p>



<p>Financial Statement Fraud </p>



<p>This type of fraud is sometimes called &#8220;cooking the books,&#8221; in which financial records are altered or destroyed for financial gain or to fool investors into pouring more money into the company or to boost stock bonuses. Regardless of the aim, this kind of fraud can be devastating for a company, which is another reason accounting responsibilities must be delegated to numeral members of staff in order to prevent the funneling structure that allows this fraud to happen. </p>



<p>Tax Fraud &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the type of fraud most known to the general public. Anyone can commit tax fraud by failing to pay their taxes, but it can also happen when companies misrepresent their earnings to the IRS in order to fall into a smaller tax bracket, or take advantage of exemptions. In order to avoid this, it’s imperative that all earnings must be reported on time. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the increasing economic turbulence felt globally in 2022—thanks to factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic and unfolding energy crisis—it comes as no surprise that fraud is on the rise. Even the construction industry is not impervious to these impacts. In fact, the complexities of numerous cost outputs, suppliers, and subcontractors mean that it has never been more important to be alert to the dangers of construction fraud. If you are the one steering the ship, now is the time to be vigilant if you want to avoid your company becoming another victim statistic.</p>



<p>Those behind devious acts of construction fraud don&#8217;t often fit preconceived notions of what a scammer looks like. Trusted employees or long-serving suppliers can go rogue when times get tough. On the other side of the same coin, opportunists can get greedy when funds start to flow, which is why it&#8217;s never the wrong time to sure up your construction company&#8217;s fraud and forgery protection. While you yourself may not be the deceiver, if the ball of compliance gets dropped, it could be your company that pays the ultimate cost. Let&#8217;s look at some of the types of construction fraud that should be on your radar, and how a corporate investigator can help you ensure that everything truly tracks.</p>



<p><strong>When Construction Fraud Slips Under the Radar</strong></p>



<p>Any construction company owners knows that operating in this business means keeping a lot of plates spinning. With so many variables in play, there are inevitably also a lot of opportunities for a falsification here and a substitution there to slip by unnoticed. As if that weren&#8217;t dangerous enough, when a trusted collaborator feels emboldened, they may decide to see how far they can push their luck. If those at the helm are asleep at the wheel, construction fraud can become an epidemic that will inevitably result in a reckoning. Bringing in a corporate investigator to uncover corporate fraud at the first sign of suspicion is a prudent move indeed, but what kinds of crime will they be looking for? Here are some examples:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Subcontractor Collusion</strong><br>In a world that sees bid rigging and price fixing happen every day, pre-approving subcontractors is a must and precautionary measures should be structured into your contracts. When the stakes are high, ensuring that the most qualified and fairly priced candidate is the one you land upon may call for some corporate intelligence gathering.</li><li><strong>Fraudulent Payment Applications</strong><br>Inflated rates, falsified invoices, exaggerated labor costs, erroneous line items, and more. Sadly, intentionally falsified payment applications represent the most common form of construction fraud.</li><li><strong>Substituting Materials</strong><strong><br></strong>When the team that you&#8217;ve placed your faith in decides to switch out specified materials for lower-grade alternatives—or not bother placing them at all—the consequences can be dire. Ranging from scrambling change orders to repair a badly bodged project through to catastrophic structural failure, this type of construction fraud should not be overlooked.</li><li><strong>Manipulated Change Orders</strong><strong><br></strong>Sometimes, a construction boss doesn&#8217;t realize that original design specs had omissions in their scope until an unexpected change order arrives on their desk. Diligence is the best safeguard, but when you suspect you&#8217;ve already been hoodwinked, it&#8217;s time to call in the corporate investigations cavalry.</li><li><strong>Diverting Equipment and Materials</strong><strong><br></strong>While the odd tool may drift off now and then from the average jobsite, you don&#8217;t want your inventory to become a revolving door buffet for those who want to restock their own private stashes. This kind of construction fraud sees company purchases diverted and precious equipment siphoned away.</li><li><strong>Manipulation of the Schedule of Values</strong></li></ul>



<p>A sloppily maintained Schedule of Values is another opportunity for construction fraud to slip by unnoticed. A sly foreman or accountant might forge phony charges against concealed buyout savings in order to pocket the difference. Only the keenest of eyes will spot this kind of construction fraud once budget and performance have been balanced.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Falsified Representations</strong><br>Across America, construction contracts increasingly call for the meeting of requirements such as a percentage of minority workers, environmental stipulations, local suppliers, and more. When a subcontractor intentionally falsifies their capacity to meet such an obligation, the company can find themselves looking down the barrel of a loaded litigation situation.<br><br><strong>Seek Support From a Corporate Investigations Firm in the Know</strong></li></ul>



<p>If you suspect that your construction company may be among the many that fall prey to industry fraud in America each year, calling in a seasoned third-party investigator to launch a swift, efficient, and impartial investigation is a must. For those unsure as to whether their wider team are operating ethically, a <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-culture-audit/">Company Culture Audit</a> is the ideal tool for illuminating the current state of play and cutting a clear path towards prevention and deterrence.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-los-muertos-crew-8853503-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-134311" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-los-muertos-crew-8853503-980x655.jpg 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-los-muertos-crew-8853503-480x321.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure></div>



<p>Being able to rely on your crew operating like a well oiled machine is the difference between profit and loss for your business. When the team is cohesive, mountains can be moved and your investments are sure to pay off. But what happens if you begin to suspect a member of your crew is malingering on the job?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe they start calling in sick on Mondays and you hear that their partying is getting out of hand. Or perhaps you think they&#8217;re laid up, only to notice that they come back to work with a tan. If you can&#8217;t trust your employees, things can start to feel unstable pretty quickly—but accusing them without evidence might lead to calls of employee discrimination or unfair dismissal. In moments such as these, a private investigator is the only collaborator to consider.</p>



<p><strong>What Is Malingering?</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/malinger">dictionary definition</a> of malingering is: “To pretend or exaggerate incapacity or illness as to avoid duty or work.” It describes faking or overstating illness or incapacity in order to unjustly claim paid time off, and when its occurrence becomes pervasive, companies can find themselves with a big problem on their hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may be that an employee&#8217;s leave was originally valid but they are now exaggerating their healing time to extend their time at home, or it is possible that they strategically and deceptively called in sick so they could skip work while still lining their pockets. When it&#8217;s happening again and again, this can be a sign that <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-culture-audit/">corporate culture is sliding sideways and you need to take action fast</a>. In any case and whichever way you paint it, malingering on the job is misconduct through and through.</p>



<p><strong>When You Suspect a Member of Your Crew is Malingering</strong></p>



<p>Whatever rouses your suspicion, when you fear that a member of your crew is malingering on the job, you need to proceed with caution. Why? Because launching disciplinary proceedings, making accusations, or carrying out surveillance of your own may later turn around and bite you if is later viewed as unfair dismissal, worker discrimination, or harassment.</p>



<p>One misstep and you might find yourself not only dealing with hemorrhaging labor costs, but also the hefty bill that comes with legal action taken against you. Whatever happens next needs to be by the book and 100% impartial. This is why a third-party private investigator from a <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-investigations/">specialist corporate investigations firm</a> can be such a valued asset. With the optimal skill set for efficiency and zero chance of bias, they can give you the evidence you need to protect your company with total confidence.</p>



<p><strong>How a Private Investigator Uncovers Malingering on the Job</strong></p>



<p>If you hire a private investigator to demonstrate once and for all whether or not a member of your crew is malingering, there&#8217;s no need for it to disrupt day-to-day operations. In fact, a skilled corporate investigator will not only begin discreetly assembling an air-tight body of evidence on your behalf. They will also be able to advise you on steps to take to protect yourself legally, avoiding unwelcome surprises down the road ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as building a case that will allow you to take action goes, a private investigator will draw from a toolkit that includes sophisticated surveillance equipment, comprehensive background checks, data analysis, gathering witness statements, and even access to restricted databases used by law enforcement agencies that would be beyond the reach of your HR team. Whether evidence arises in your employee&#8217;s activities or discrepancies in their medical documentation, the truth will come to light.</p>

<p>When thinking about the security of your business, it&#8217;s easy to place focus on brick and mortar assets, valuable inventory, and carefully counted financials. However, there is another area of your business that needs to be protected at all costs. As the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/white-collar-crime/piracy-ip-theft">FBI confirms</a>, intellectual property theft robs unsuspecting U.S. businesses of billions of dollars every year, stealing job security from hard-working Americans and tax revenues in the process. The takeaway? Don&#8217;t let your lack of awareness make you a number in next year&#8217;s statistics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is intellectual property protection such a prolific problem? Well, <a href="https://www.heerlaw.com/value-intellectual-property">estimates place</a> the value of intellectual property at about 70% of all business equity. This plump statistic makes the data and—in fact—the very <em>ideas</em> that fuel your business a tempting target for aspiring criminals. As such, an intellectual property private investigator is an ally that shouldn&#8217;t be overlooked.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Who Are the Perpetrators Behind Intellectual Property Theft?</strong></li></ol>



<p>When someone decides to steal your organization&#8217;s customer data, product plans, pricing strategy, or design secrets, it&#8217;s important to know that while they might be an unknown agent, the criminal in question could well be a trusted insider—a wolf in your midst. It is a sad truth that disgruntled or ill-intentioned employees take it upon themselves to steal sensitive data from the hand that feeds them every day in America, making complacency a dangerous game indeed.</p>



<p>Perhaps a rival business has approached a member of your team with an under-the-table offer, or maybe they hope to gather intel before setting up a rival business. Whatever the motivation, common data extraction tactics include the use of external media such as a writable CD or USB mass storage device, or harnessing corporate email accounts to send information off-site. In other instances, intellectual property theft may involve hacking, making digital security paramount to your IP&#8217;s security. Establishing IT and site monitoring procedures and media policy controls are also key to maintaining employee best practices, supported by well-constructed non-compete agreements for staff privy to precious information.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"><li><strong>Prevention and Cure: Hiring An Intellectual Property Investigator</strong></li></ol>



<p>When a company suspects intellectual property theft, there is no time to waste. Whether a copyright investigation, a trademark theft investigation, or a more nuanced IP infringement investigation is called for, you can be certain that the longer that information is in circulation, the greater the potential threat to your company. As such, setting an intellectual property theft investigator to the task of tracing the breach, identifying proof, and gathering the evidence that will allow you to act quickly is a shrewd move indeed.</p>



<p>In parallel, many businesses choose to engage a private investigator as a form of proactive intellectual property protection. Experts within this corporate field can conduct careful analysis of your IP assets, detecting any potential vulnerabilities or violations before crisis sets in. A skilled corporate theft investigator from Lauth Investigations international will work tirelessly to prevent intellectual property breaches, global piracy, counterfeiting, and insider threats, utilizing tools such as data mining techniques, surveillance, and field investigation to uncover facts inaccessible to your HR department.</p>



<p>Is your intellectual property safe from prying eyes? If in doubt, <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/contact-lauth-investigations/">contact Lauth Investigations International today</a>, for bespoke guidance from a dedicated IP infringement investigator. Your intellectual assets represent the future prosperity of your brand, so don&#8217;t leave their integrity to chance.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="788" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/empfraud_57288420-1024x788.png" alt="" class="wp-image-134109" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/empfraud_57288420-980x755.png 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/empfraud_57288420-480x370.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure></div>



<p>Imagine, if you will, that you&#8217;re a mid-level manager, and you&#8217;ve had an eye on Bob for a while. Bob&#8217;s always struck you as an easy going family guy, but recently you&#8217;ve noticed that his behaviour has become a little strange.</p>



<p>Bob&#8217;s clothes are a little more flashy and you noticed a brand new wristwatch catching the light under his shirt sleeve—but it&#8217;s not just that. Bob has started staying late more than he used to, and doing things like closing his office door more often, or turning his screen away when you walk by. You debate whether you should talk to the HR director about the issue. Your gut tells you something is wrong, but you wonder what can be done about it—can you really trigger a corporate investigation on the basis of a hunch?</p>



<p>Moments like these can be the beginning of an unravelling that reveals an employee engaged in workplace fraud. But, the signs and signals are often blurry at best. Your imagined mid-level manager&#8217;s logic does have some fairly solid foundations—research indicates that <a href="https://acfepublic.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020-Report-to-the-Nations.pdf">42% of fraudsters</a> do, after all, live beyond their means. But just as easily, another individual engaged in fraud may do a far better job of covering their tracks, while Bob might just have come into a small inheritance.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Problem Not to Underestimate</strong></h3>



<p>What are the risks to contemporary organizations? Employee fraud, forgery, workplace theft, malingering, white collar crime—the list goes on. In fact, it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/employee-theft-statistics/#gref">estimated</a> that US businesses lose up to $110 million a day due to employee related crimes, while a typical employee theft-scheme lasts 14 months before being detected. The reality is that no business can afford to be asleep at the wheel when it comes to employee fraud.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth saying, too, that when we say <em>no</em> business, we really mean it. If you&#8217;re imagining that your company or organization is simply too small to fall prey to these kinds of problems, think again. The sad <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/employee-theft-statistics/#gref">reality</a> is that the risk of payroll schemes and billing fraud is actually twice as high in small businesses as it is in large ones.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Exactly is Employee Fraud?</strong></h3>



<p>To any business owner, CEO, CFO, or Human Relations Director who hasn&#8217;t felt the viciously stinging impact of fraud before, it sounds like a big word. Surely <em>fraud</em> is something relegated to big-scale scandals that hit the news, right? Well, fraud can happen on any scale, and the perpetrator can be an ordinary Joe or Jane—or indeed a Bob gone rogue.<br><br>Employee fraud is a deliberate and deceptive act that aims to provide the perpetrator with unlawful gain, taking advantage of their position of authority or trust. It can happen under the watchful eye of any organization—large or small—and the consequences can be complex and far-reaching.</p>



<p>Examples of employee fraud might include financial statement fraud, the misappropriation of assets, payroll fraud, colluding with suppliers, credit card fraud, cash skimming or larceny, bribery, or data fraud. Occurrences can also range in scale from minor false expenses claims, right through to large-scale embezzlement that is haemorrhaging company profits. Whatever the scale, if your business is a victim of fraud, action must be taken.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tackling Employee Fraud Head-On</strong></h3>



<p>Internal threats can come in many forms. If you suspect any form of employee fraud, then the time to launch a corporate investigation is now. When a red flag is raised for these kinds of issues in the workplace, the next steps taken need to be cautious. A heavy-handed approach may send fraudsters under cover, while dangerously disrupting workplace dynamics.</p>



<p>Knowing who to trust is these instances can also be a challenge—could colleagues be colluding, or might HR find it difficult to be impartial about a beloved co-worker? Because of the legal and psychological complexities of employee fraud, turning to a trusted corporate investigations service can be the strongest tactic. Seasoned professional corporate investigators can quickly and discreetly get to the bottom of the matter, and provide invaluable advice on how to move forwards.</p>
