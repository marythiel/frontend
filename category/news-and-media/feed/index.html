<p>Romance scams have become a global problem, resulting in heartbreak and financial loss. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/02/love-stinks-when-scammer-involved">Federal Trade Commission</a>, consumers lost $1.14 billion to romance scams in 2023. The typical victim lost $4,400—an amount that could completely ruin many emotionally and financially—as scammers employ ever more advanced strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowledge of these frauds is vital not only for your financial and <strong>personal security</strong> but also for safeguarding your loved ones. By seeing red flags, encouraging <strong>scam prevention</strong>, and using resources like background checks, you may navigate internet interactions with more confidence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-romance-scams"><strong>Understanding Romance Scams</strong></h2>



<p>Romance scams are when con artists establish false internet identities to fool victims into starting love connections. Once confidence is built, con artists financially and emotionally prey on their victims. These programs can aim for those using social media, dating apps, or even professional networking sites.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Over 70,000 Americans were victims of romance scams in 2023.</li>



<li>Over the past five years, <strong>financial loss</strong> from these scams has doubled, reflecting fraudsters&#8217; developing expertise.</li>



<li>Targeting weaker populations, including elderly folks who might be less familiar with online safety measures, scammers increasingly prey on</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-tactics-used-by-romance-scammers"><strong>Common Tactics Used by Romance Scammers</strong></h2>



<p>Romance fraudsters control their victims by the use of several psychological and technological strategies. Knowing these techniques will keep you alert.</p>



<p><strong>Emotional Manipulation</strong></p>



<p>Early in the relationship, con artists sometimes declare their love to establish emotional reliance. To establish trust, they might say things such as, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never felt this way before&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re my soulmate.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Fabricated Emergencies</strong></p>



<p>One of the most often used strategies is creating problems by asking for financial aid. One such claim is that they are stranded overseas and require funds to get back home.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Notifying serious medical events needing quick money.</li>



<li>Declaring their company endeavor failed, they found themselves in a terrible financial situation.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Avoidance of Direct Interaction</strong></p>



<p>Often citing military deployment as their justification, scammers refuse to meet in person or engage in video chats.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Military deployment.</li>



<li>Remote employment sites</li>



<li>Technical issues with their equipment.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Requests for Money</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Many times, they want cash help via wire transfers.</li>



<li>Gift cards (which are untraceable).</li>



<li>Claiming either speed or safety, cryptocurrencies</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recognizing-red-flags-in-online-relationships"><strong>Recognizing Red Flags in Online Relationships</strong></h2>



<p>Early identification of questionable activities will help you avoid major emotional and financial damage. Here are critical indicators to be on the lookout for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Overwhelming Expressions of Love:</strong> Unusually fast expressions of love raise a serious red signal.</li>



<li><strong>Pressure to Act Immediately:</strong> Scammers may demand immediate cash assistance, saying lives depend on your actions.</li>



<li><strong>Discrepancies in Their Stories:</strong> Their stories often show differences in upbringing, work line, or location.</li>



<li><strong>Refusal to Meet:</strong> Genuine relationships entail actual engagement; con artists try to avoid this at all possible.</li>



<li><strong>Financial Assistance Requests:</strong> Any <strong>financial safety</strong> request—especially early in the relationship—is quite suspect.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-protect-yourself-from-romance-scams"><strong>How to Protect Yourself from Romance Scams?</strong></h2>



<p>Using proactive steps helps to prevent internet fraud:</p>



<p><strong>Practice Caution on Dating Platforms</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Dating apps and websites are common hunting grounds for fraud. Use sites that confirm user-profiles and provide online interaction safety advice.</p>



<p><strong>Verify Their Identity</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Look at their profile photos in a basic reverse image search to discover whether they are shared elsewhere. Often, scammers grab photographs from social media or stock photo websites.</p>



<p><strong>Avoid Sharing Personal Details</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Share less personal information online— avoid providing your address, place of employment, or bank records.</p>



<p><strong>Educate Yourself</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>Stay updated on the most recent methods of fraud. Government and <strong>consumer protection</strong> agency websites often feature current data on internet fraud.</p>



<p><strong>Use Background Checks</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>A background check is among the best techniques for guaranteeing the validity of an online relationship. This service can reveal criminal records and is something Lauth Investigations International is well-versed at providing, as we can reveal the information below, and more:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Criminal history</li>



<li>Financial history</li>



<li>Residential history</li>



<li>Employment verification</li>



<li>Education credentials&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steps-to-take-if-you-suspect-a-scam"><strong>Steps to Take If You Suspect a Scam</strong></h2>



<p>Should you feel you have come across a romance scam, move fast to limit damage:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cut-Off Communication:</strong> Many times, scammers try to control victims into staying in the relationship.</li>



<li><strong>Report the Incident: </strong>Tell the following authorities:</li>



<li><strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC):</strong> Through their <strong>online fraud</strong> portal.</li>



<li><strong>Use Social Media Wisely</strong>: The platform you came up with the scammer on—perhaps attack on <strong>dating app safety</strong> or social media.</li>



<li><strong>Protect Your Finances:</strong> Call your credit card company or bank to stop purchases and track your accounts for unusual behavior.</li>



<li><strong>Seek Professional Help:</strong> Ask private investigators to compile proof or verify the validity of your internet relationship.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>In this digital age, romance scams are a big problem because they play on people&#8217;s feelings and cause them to lose a lot of money. You may guard yourself and your loved ones by being alert, spotting red signals, and using background checks and other resources. Encouragement of scam awareness falls on all of us; by means of proactive actions, we may lower the prevalence of online fraud.</p>

<p>Earlier this January, the world of the NFL was completely rocked by the collapse of Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin on the field during a cardiac arrest that stopped the game cold in a historically unprecedented event. Damar Hamlin spent more than a week in the hospital as physicians attempted to untangle the cause and effect of the cardiac arrest in the 24-year-old safety. He was then discharged with the full confidence of his doctors to continue rehabilitation at home according to a statement released by the Bills. While the freak occurrence has sparked an outpouring of emotional and financial support for Damar Hamlin and his charitable foundation respectively, it has also sparked a larger conversation amongst players, commentators, and fans alike regarding how the NFL cares for their best and boldest when it comes to their quality of care and investment in their longevity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In team sports such as football, where the players play under the direction or control of a coach and/or manager, they are considered employees of the parent organization—in this case the NFL. It’s difficult to think of sports franchises as having a corporate structure, but in the same way the practices, policies, and procedures of a corporation can have an effect on the employees at the bottom of the chain of command, the way the NFL chooses how to prioritize the health and well-being of their players obviously has a ripple effect throughout the franchise. When talking about corporate culture, leadership is always advised to prioritize the health and happiness of their employees over profit, and players in the NFL should be no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Damar Hamlin was originally hospitalized during a game in Cincinatti against the Bengals when his heart stopped following a tackle on January 2. While no cause of Hamlin’s cardiac arrest and collapse has been publicly disclosed, the Bills’ Twitter account reported that he underwent a “comprehensive medical evaluation, as well as a series of cardiac, neurological, and vascular testing.” His recovery from this incident was accredited to the swift response of medical personnel who rushed the field after Hamlin went down—Hamlin was revived twice before even being taken off the field—actions which not only saved his life, but his long-term neurological function. The incident shook both players and fans alike as they struggled to wrap their minds around how a 24-year-old, second-year NFL player could suffer such a traumatic medical event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game was eventually cancelled outright by the NFL, garnering raised eyebrows and visions of a future pivot of values within the league that prioritizes players’ health and safety over the fan experience of the sport. It’s true that pro-athletes have suffered devastating injuries on the field before, but the overall reaction from the teams, the staff, fans, and the NFL have marked this event as significant in the ongoing discourse surrounding care of pro-athletes. While Hamlin may have received thoughts and prayers from fellow players and fans, it still left open the question of how Hamlin would be able to access financial support for his medical needs in the event he would not be able to play another game in the NFL. Due to being only two years into his contract, Hamlin would not have been able to access his pension. However, after an appeal to the NFL and NFLPA by the Bills organization on his behalf, in an unprecedented move, it has been announced that Damar Hamlin’s contract has been adjusted so that he can have access to the $3.64 million set out in his four-year contract with the Bills—a decision that could be a harbinger of positive changes on the horizon when it comes to the terms of future pro-athletes&#8217; contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What happened to Damar Hamlin has sparked a comprehensive conversation regarding the terms of players’ contracts and how the NFL chooses to enforce those contracts. Choosing to pay Damar Hamlin in full for a four-year contract in his second year of tenure with the Bills to mitigate the financial impact of what he survived on the football field is an undeniable prioritization of his well-being. Should the NFL continue to make similar decisions with other players who are injured during games going forward, it would be a marked improvement in the corporate culture of the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the release of a report by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform, more is known than ever about Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder and the role he played in perpetuating a toxic work culture within the franchise. The 97-page report has outlined for the public how Snyder “permitted and participated” in the Commanders’ toxic culture, including the obstruction and obfuscation of a congressional inquiry through evasion, witness intimidation, and remaining obtuse when questioned by the committee. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to highlighting Snyder’s level of participation in disrupting the congressional inquiry regarding the toxic work culture, the report also indicated that the NFL, describing them as also sharing in the blame when it came to the subversion of the congressional inquiry. The chairperson of the committee, Rep. Carolyn Maloney told <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35205965/snyder-permitted-participated-washington-commanders-toxic-culture-nfl-aided-cover-up">ESPN</a>, “We saw efforts that we have never seen before, at least I haven’t. The NFL knew about it, and they took know responsibility.” Maloney’s went on to characterize the NFL’s actions as performative, describing a “coordinated effort to hide what they acknowledged.” Maloney is referring of course to the NFL’s effort bury an investigation into the toxic work culture of the Commanders, led by attorney Beth Wilkinson.  </p>



<p>According to the committee’s congressional report, Wilkinson’s investigation found multiple allegations of harassment and abuse against other teams, and that the NFL prioritized the interests of league owners over those of their own employees, with multiple reports of failure to protect employees who could not report misconduct without fear of retaliation. The report stated, “Rather than seek accountability, the NFL aligned its legal interests with Mr. Snyder’s, failed to curtail his abusive tactics, and buried the investigation’s findings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite these findings of a toxic work culture against the organization and Dan Snyder, the NFL has declared their commitment to courses of action that directly contradict the findings of the report, with NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy releasing a statement that said the NFL is “committed to ensuring that all employees of the NFL and the 32 clubs work in a professional and supportive environment that is free from discrimination, harassment, and other forms of illegal or unprofessional conduct.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the release of the congressional report, head coach Ron Rivera told <a href="https://www.dcnewsnow.com/sports/professional-sports/nfl/washington-football/rivera-revisits-culture-change-conversation-with-snyder-under-fire/">DC News Now</a> that he has continued to encourage his players to “focus on what’s in front of them, not the distractions,” as they move forward.  </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elon.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-160426" width="461" height="283"/></figure>



<p>To say that Elon Musk has had a turbulent fourth quarter in 2022 would be an understatement as he continues to face new challenges and find innovative ways to remain divisive in his capacity as Twitter’s new chief executive officer. Since purchasing the company for a record $44 billion in 2022, the landscape of the platform has been nothing short of chaotic as Musk declared war on Apple for gouging their advertising campaigns and allegedly continues to champion free speech as the new CEO. The public’s reaction to these events have ranged from the vindicated to the horrified, but in all the pageantry of the possible flame-out, there are human beings who are being forgotten in the chaos—what remains of Twitter’s staff. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in October, Musk’s deal to purchase the platform finally went through after months of back and forth in a “will he, won’t he” corporate dance. Once he became the CEO of Twitter, however, he immediately fired half of the staff, as well as CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal, and announced that that he would be championing free speech on the platform in a way that he alleged had not previously been done before. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It wasn’t long before Twitter engineers began coming forward about some of the changes Musk was making. One engineer, Eric Frohnhoefer, got into a public argument with Musk on Twitter, which culminated in Musk apparently firing him through a tweet—and it did not stop there. Musk went on to fire as many as 20 other engineers who had spoken out against his actions either publicly or on the platform’s internal Slack channels. To the remaining staff, Musk sent a company-wide email with vague implications that operations were about to get more difficult, and demands employees commit to working “long hours at high intensity,” or face termination. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Since purchasing the platform, Elon Musk continues to rot the corporate culture of Twitter from within. It’s horrific enough to have public feuds with employees and increasing demands on a reduced staff, but some of the latest reports regarding work conditions at Twitter are nothing short of disturbing. The BBC reported just yesterday they had received photos of Twitter office space that had been converted into actual bedrooms. The photo shared by the BBC showed a double bed and a dresser along with a pair of slippers. There was also a photo of couches at Twitter HQ being used as beds. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Scott Wiener, a California state senator commented to the BBC, “It’s clear that he doesn’t really care about people. He doesn’t care about the people who work for him.” The photos have prompted an investigation by the San Fransisco Department of Building Inspection into whether or not violations are being made. An official from the department told CBS News, “We need to make sure the building is being used as intended.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>As the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-executives-said-about-george-floyds-death-11591364538?st=evuer0h04s4nkwj"> Black Lives Matter movement</a> continues throughout the globe, corporate diversity is once again on the minds of leadership in the United States. Leadership has begun developing strategies to improve diversity in their structure. Regardless of the motivations behind resisting this change, leadership might not understand that corporate diversity is a measure that not only elevates BIPOC professionals, but will improve the quality of life within the corporation. </p>



<p>When leadership is singular in representation, it cannot
possibly consider all the needs of everyone in the organization. Leadership
that is composed entirely of White executives will have a functional blindness
or bias towards the needs of non-White employees. Not only will they leave
their non-White employees feeling undervalued, but corporations can be selling
themselves short on opportunity to improve business from within, and ultimately
from without. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New ideas </strong></h2>



<p>One of the most obvious benefits to having corporate
diversity—both at the executive level and below—is that diversity breeds
innovation and creativity. When a corporation continually relies on the same
thinktank of people who all come from similar backgrounds and have similar
experiences, you will eventually begin to see a patter in the same 15 ideas or
solutions generated by that thinktank. Workforces with diverse backgrounds see
a more diverse array of ideas, innovations, and solutions to challenges faced
in the workplace and in the market. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Better ideas </strong></h2>



<p>The more corporate diversity you have, the more likely your
team will generate ideas and solutions that will better serve your customer
base. Different skills and different histories of experience will lead to a
more unique brainstorm—from the conference room to the loading dock. According
to a study conducted by the Harvard Business Review, businesses with corporate
diversity are able to find solutions to problems faster than teams of employees
from similar backgrounds. The speed attributed to corporate diversity is due in
part to the fact that these corporations foster an environment that promotes a
free exchange of ideas, where everyone has a place at the table and their voice
is heard. That is the sort of corporate culture all businesses should be
striving for. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Better culture </strong></h2>



<p>Diversity is more than a two-pronged approach, but it is important that you have diversity from the top down, and that every person feel as though they can safely bring ideas, concerns, or solutions to the table. By encouraging this diversity, you make sure every person on your team feels as though their voice is being heard. When employees feel heard and valued, the corporate culture of the entire business significantly improves. We know<a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/08/08/the-cycle-of-corporate-culture/"> the effects of corporate culture move in a cycl</a>e. Employees are either positively or negatively impacted by engagement and validation from leadership, which in turn effects their own engagement, which directly impacts their level of output. As corporate culture improves, output increases. The elevation of those diverse voices has the capacity to save your corporation money in billable hours, workplace lawsuits, and engagement. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-6.jpg" alt="Molson Coors shooting
" class="wp-image-2291"/></figure>



<p>Just after lunch last Wednesday, violence erupted in
Milwaukee, WI at the famous Molson Coors factory, when an employee walked in with
a loaded firearm and began shooting, leaving 5 victims and the shooter
deceased. The violence is another in a string of shootings in the workplace that
has corporate leadership wondering what their role is in limiting these acts of
violence.</p>



<p>The victims in the Milwaukee Molson Coors shooting were identified as Jesus Valle Jr., 33; Gennady Levshetz, 61; Trevor Wetselaar, 33; Dana Walk, 57; and Dale Hudson, 60. The shooter, electrician Anthony N. Ferrill, 51, is deceased as well. Those victims, Ferrill’s coworkers, are remembered by the dozens of friends and family they left behind, as well as a community rocked by violence. Molson Coors chief executive Gavin Hattersley said in a news conference, “They were husbands, they were fathers, and they were friends. They were a part of the fabric of our company and our community, and we will miss them terribly.” </p>



<p>While many acts of violence in the workplace are perpetrated
by former employees, Anthony Ferrill was a current employee of Molson Coors.
Ferrill worked in the building’s utilities department. While authorities have
not established a clear motive for the shooting, according to the<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/02/milwaukee-molson-coors-shooting-miller-brewery-anthony-ferrill/4928061002/">
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,</a> Ferrill had a history of dispute with his coworkers
that many have speculated finally came to a head in the events leading up to last
week’s shooting. The dispute may have had racial overtones, with Ferrill
accusing other employees of discriminating against him in the workplace. He had
suspicions that other employees were trespassing at his home, bugging his
electronic devices, and disturbing his property. With the exception of one man,
Ferrill had previous confrontations with all the victims, yet police have
declined to comment on how the shooting occurred. </p>



<p>When shocking incidents of violence like this occur in the workplace,
it’s not uncommon to hear from leadership in the organization that they are ‘shocked,’
or ‘astonished’ at the events that have taken place, or that the violence was
perpetrated by a member of their organization. The reality is that active
shooter events and other forms of violence in the workplace can usually be
anticipated and prevented if leadership is not asleep at the wheel.</p>



<p>Most workplace crises, from violence to theft, can be traced
back to faulty internal operations. That’s why so many corporations are seeking
to have their daily operations evaluated by independent investigators and risk
assessment firms. These investigators come into your business and begin examining
hiring processes, onboarding materials, employee engagement, and the turnover
rate in an attempt to identify the problems that cause frustration within the organization.
In the unfortunate example of Molsen Coors, there was obviously room for more
supervision with regards to intra-employee conflict. If the alleged
intra-employee conflict had been given more attention, it might not have ended
in violence. </p>



<p>Corporate Culture Audit investigators can provide leadership with the insight they need to improve their daily operations. Investigators can review hiring protocol, identifying risk factors and lack of oversight. They can review security systems, both in cyberspace, and at brick-and-mortar locations to identify weaknesses that would leave the company vulnerable to attack. These are measures that could have prevented the violence that broke out at Molson Coors, and they can protect your company, too. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ilexapp-find-local-lawyer.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2261"/><figcaption>The National Law Relations Board reverses controversial position on internal investigations.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Employers across the country have operated in a sea of gray area when it comes to confidentiality among employees regarding internal investigations. The question remained whether or not employers were able to require employees to keep internal investigations internal while they were in full swing. Prior to the new year, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) finally answered that question. </p>



<p>Previously, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had
taken a position that employers could not require employees to keep ongoing
internal investigations confidential because it generally violated labor law. Section
7 of the National Labor Relations Act guarantees employees “the right to
self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain
collectively through representatives of their own choosing.” Universal
requirement of confidentiality could potentially interfere with that law.
Confidentiality in internal investigations was instead dealt with on a
case-by-case basis, with no precedent for blanket confidentiality. This topic
has been in review by the NLRB since May of 2019, but it was only recently that
the board announced that they had reversed their position. </p>



<p>By their very nature,<a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/12/02/10-steps-to-conducting-internal-investigations/"> internal investigations</a> are already a big headache for many employers. Further compounding these frustrations is the ideation that no internal investigation can generate meaningful results unless the integrity of the internal investigation is maintained by all employees of the corporation or organization. This new standard of approval by the National Labor Relations Board is a categorical win for employers.  The win comes down to one word—duration. In articulating their decision, the majority wrote, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“There are obvious mutual interests to be served by encouraging and allowing employees to report wrongdoing without fear of reprisal from the subject of the investigation. Among other considerations, such reporting promotes the goals of the antidiscrimination statutes by helping employers eradicate workplace discrimination and deal with it promptly and effectively when it occurs.” </p></blockquote>



<p>This articulation is indirectly evocative of the cycle of
corporate culture, a process by which cause and effect on the parts of both
leadership and employees in pursuit of improved operations leads to a healthy
corporate culture for the entire workforce. </p>



<p>While there are concerns that the future of this reversal
may affect an employee’s ability to organize, the projection of this reversal
is very good news for internal investigations. In any investigation, the
control of information is critical to finding solutions to the corporate
crisis, allowing investigators to use tried-and-true methodology to get to the
root of the problem. With the NLRB finally taking a position that allows
employers to require confidentiality, the integrity of those internal
investigations can now be maintained from the onset, leading to clearer
solutions for the pervasive issues that malign corporations and organizations. </p>

<p><a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/09/corporate-crisis-contextual-crises-within-major-retailers/">Corporations and institutions with relative high visibility</a> have a lot to lose when internal misconduct is exposed. If you are an institution, such as a school, prison, or government body, internal misconduct can strongly shake the public’s confidence in how that misconduct will impact the groups and communities being served. Embarrassing, pervasive issues, such as a business party culture, can really drive down faith in your brand. If you’re a large corporate chain, such as Walmart, or McDonald’s, your corporate culture is subject to criticism from current/past employees, with heavy emphasis on how that <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/06/does-your-corporation-need-a-culture-audit/">corporate culture effects both productivity and the workforce. </a></p>



<p>Just one week after ringing in the new year, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-looks-beyond-party-culture-11578243600">McDonald’s current CEO, Chris Kempczinski,</a> has announced that he plans to bring an end to the business party culture embroiled in their corporate atmosphere. According to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Kempczinski, “…is seeking to restore a more professional culture at McDonald’s after what some current and former employees described as an environment influenced by his predecessor’s late-night socializing with some executives and staffers at bars and flirtations with female employees…” This business party culture was pervasive. His predecessor, Steve Eastbrook, was terminated in November of 2019 after he confessed to having a relationship with an employee. What is particularly problematic about these circumstances is that healthy corporate culture begins with leadership. When leadership behaves ethically within the organization, employees are more likely to follow that example. When executives, managers, and supervisors are not held accountable for bad behavior, it sends a message to the rest of the organization that poisons the well of corporate culture. </p>



<p>But inappropriate personal conduct is not the only challenge
currently facing McDonald’s culture. Strains imposed by the franchises’
renovation program has franchisees challenging their relationship with the
corporation. In addition, unions are still reeling from a decision handed down
by a national union-organizing supervision board, which states that the
corporation will no longer be liable for labor violations committed by its
franchisees. Labor advocates who made their concerns apparent to the board were
ignored, and the decision came down with a 2-1 vote. In the background,
employees continue their cause of “Fight For 15,” in reference to their desire
to have McDonald’s starting wage raised to $15 per hour. </p>



<p>Kempczinski’s promise to diffuse a business party culture within the corporation is a promising start—however, in order to make meaningful changes to the corporation, there needs to be a top-to-bottom evaluation of internal processes, and of the behavior exhibited by leadership—both in the public view and behind closed doors. That is why so many institutions and corporations are subjecting their internal operations to a corporate culture audit to ensure that they won’t be caught unawares about the debilitating, pervasive issues within their organization. Regardless of quality, corporate culture moves in a cycle. The actions of leadership filter down through the workforce, influencing productivity and engagement from employees. Employees either contribute positively or negatively to the corporation as a result of that leadership, and that leads directly back to leadership in a supervisory capacity. For the sake of a long-beloved American corporation, let’s hope that Kempczinski follows through on his promise for change. </p>

<p>It’s mind-boggling to think that some of the most controversial scandals in our country’s history have taken place only in the last decade. Corporate scandal is a hot media item, with the misbehavior of employees at all levels facing public scrutiny.  <a href="https://chiefexecutive.net/how-to-conduct-a-quality-internal-investigation/">Information on corporations and their corporate culture</a> is more visible than ever as experts continue to place more and more importance on work-life balance, and satisfaction in the workplace remaining the driving force behind employee engagement. As technology and the ubiquity of accessible information continues to advance, private United States citizens are becoming more informed about the largest corporations in the nation, how their behavior effects their corporate footprint, and how their own consumerism can affect these corporations. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">BP Oil Spil </h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/deepwater_horizon_BP_oil_rig_gulf_of_mexico_collapse-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2214" width="370" height="277"/></figure></div>



<p>There’s no better place to start than at the beginning. In April of 2010, the oil and gas conglomerate BP began the new decade with an oil spill so catastrophic that we’re still talking about the environmental impact ten years later. The corporate scandal also involved devastating loss. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, which broke open the will, dumping between 2.5 and 4.2 million barrels of oil into the gulf before it could be capped once more. For thousands of miles, the oil slicks contributed to the deterioration of marine life and had cost the corporation in excess of $65 billion dollars before 2020. In an article published in June of 2010, Peter Fairly of MIT Technology stated, “A culture of tighter safety and more experienced regulators might have prevented the BP Deepwater Horizon leak.” Under the terms of a settlement, BP agreed to pay the Natural Resource Damage Asessment Trustees up to $8.8 billion for restoration work to rebuild the natural environment that was damaged by the spill. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Foxconn Suicides</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/360_foxconn_0525.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2219" width="262" height="171"/></figure></div>



<p>Later in 2010, there was an alarming string of suicides at a plant run by Foxconn, a Chinese corporation that produces roughly 40% of the world’s consumer electronic components—technology that builds our smartphones, gaming consoles, and other forms of smart technology. These tragedies were covered heavily in American media as questions arose to the quality of labor conditions in these Chinese plants. In subsequent investigations, it was revealed that workers could be working 12-hour shifts, with less than a dollar (U.S.) in their pocket for food. While the suicides received a great deal of coverage, and had public relations repercussions for corporations that utilize Foxconn exports, there have been at least 8 additional suicides at the same factor have been reported since 2010. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FIFA Corruption</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/141219143522-sepp-story-top.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2222" width="338" height="189"/></figure></div>



<p>Few things are more universally loved across the globe than soccer, or football, as it’s known in the rest of the world. In May of 2015, millions of soccer fans were shaken by the FIFA corruption corporate scandal. The Department of Justice indicted the Federation Internationale de Football Association leadership on charges of racketeering, wire fraud, and money-laundering. The indictment outlined various instances of an excess of $15 million dollars in bribes taken by executives for preserving advertisement marketing rights for decades. The scandal lead to the resignation of President Sepp Blatter in June of 2015 after he managed to escape indictment. Millions of dollars in legal costs and loss of corporate sponsorship severely damaged the reputation of the organization, netting losses of $122.4 million. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theranos &amp; Elizabeth Holmes </h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/974_main.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2229"/></figure></div>



<p>The scandal surrounding the health technology company known as Theranos was a cluster 15 years in the making. Once again a corporate scandal that effected public health, both the executive and the corporation were villified in the media. Stemming from a fear of needles when she was a child, founder Elizabeth Holmes was seeking to develop a technology that would lead to higher accessibility of blood-testing throughout the world. Her device supposedly would be able to perform a smattering of biological tests from a single drop of blood. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> published an expose in October of 2015, exposing more of the company’s deception and further implicating some of Holmes’ colleagues in the scandal. Holmes was charged with massive fraud in March 2018. Formerly thought of as a young genius, she is scheduled to stand trial in 2020, facing up to 20 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Big Pharma &amp; the Opioid Crisis</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/opioids_smartstock_istock_thinkstock2.jpg" alt="Corporate Scandals " class="wp-image-2231"/></figure></div>



<p>Corporate scandal is at it&#8217;s worst when it comes to public health. The ever-growing opioid crisis in the United States is hands down one of the most pervasive scandals of the last decade. In 2017 alone, there were over 70,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States. Of those overdose deaths, 67% came from an overdose of opioids. From the Midwest to the Northeast, opioid deaths spiked between 2016 and 2017. As of November 2019, six pharmaceutical companies were under federal investigation and were facing federal charges for their responsibility for the opioid crisis. Amongst other big pharma companies, Purdue Pharma reached settled for billions of dollars for communities in 23 states that were affected by their shipment of opioids, forcing the company to ultimately filing for bankruptcy. The settlement set major precedent as the first of it’s kind in our American legal system. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Virginia legislation placed on notice following the active shooter event in Virginia Beach. </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5cf2e8aa07279.image_-1024x565.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2135"/><figcaption>Victims of the Virginia Beach shooting.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In what has seemed like a death from a thousand cuts, the mass active shooter event that occurred on Friday, May 28<sup>th</sup> at a municipal building in Virginia Beach has inspired action on the part of state leadership. According to<em> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/04/virginia-beach-shooting-gov-northam-calls-special-session-guns/1337559001/">USA Today</a></em>, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has ordered a legislative session devoted to exploring the current climate of gun violence in the United states. At a news conference, Northam said, “The nation is watching. We must do more than our thoughts and prayers. We must give Virginians the action they deserve.” </p>



<p>It was a public works employee who killed 12 people last week—another senseless tragedy in a long line of mass shootings that have spiked in recent years. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, shootings accounted for 79% of all workplace homicides in 2016. Statistics from the Office of Victims of Violent Crime indicate this number has not only risen dramatically but will continue to rise. The number of mass shootings was nearly 2.5 times greater over the last ten years—greater than the mass shootings that occurred between 1998 and 2007. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/states-stats-active-shooter.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2136"/><figcaption>This infographic displays the number of active shooter events in each state in 2018, per 1 million individuals. </figcaption></figure>



<p>While the governor of Virginia has put the legislation on notice, <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2018/11/active-shooter-training-workplace/">businesses throughout the nation</a> have put themselves on notice as well, with interest in active shooter training programs for businesses increasing exponentially with each new report of gun violence in the workplace. What’s chilling is OSHA estimates 25% of workplace violence goes unreported.  Yet, many businesses believe events like the ones that transpired in Virginia Beach cannot happen to them.</p>



<p>Many businesses not only believe an active shooter event is unlikely, but that they are, in fact, prepared for one. If you happen to be reading this at your desk, or on a break at your job, do you know the evacuation protocol for your business in the event of an active shooter? Evacuation procedures like these are often explained in personnel materials like handbooks and manuals. But the average employee is not regularly engaged on the topic, let alone received comprehensive education &amp; demonstration of these protocols. It is a morbid, serious subject, and it is not uncommon for management or leadership in a business/organization to be uncomfortable with addressing it, and certainly struggle with addressing it comprehensively. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/graphic-5-location-categories2017-1024x599.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2137"/><figcaption>This downloadable graphic reflects statistical information pertaining to the 220 FBI-designated active shooter incidents that occurred in the United States between 2000-2016. This graphic depicts incidents broken down by location category.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Companies who have decided that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure are investing in contracts with independent investigators to perform risk assessments on their headquarters and locations of business. These investigators consider factors such as the total volume of personnel, layout of the worksite, and security protocol to determine what is needed to keep the employees safe and secure. </p>



<p>These horrific crimes are also placing a heavy financial burden on businesses. Lower &amp; Associates estimates businesses across the United States will lose more than $55 million in employee wages each year due to violence in the workplace. They experience direct losses in the form of medical expenses, workers’ compensation, litigation fees, and indirect losses such as breakdown in operations due to arrested productivity, record-low morale, and public relation nightmares. Not to mention the fact that a business’s preparedness for an active shooter event is literally a matter of life and death. </p>
