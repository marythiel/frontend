<p>Aiming to raise team cohesiveness and morale, the holiday season sometimes offers cheerful business meetings. However, These incidents can result in employee misbehavior, exposing businesses to major legal and reputation hazards. According to a Society for Human Resource Management survey, 36% of companies have seen <strong>corporate security</strong> involving improper behavior and heavy drinking at holiday parties. Safe and successful holiday celebrations depend on strong business security practices being followed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-importance-of-corporate-security-for-holiday-events"><strong>The Importance of Corporate Security for Holiday Events</strong></h2>



<p>Corporate security goes beyond providing physical protection to establish an environment where every staff member feels respected and safe. Joyous holiday celebrations may blur the boundaries between personal and professional behavior, but companies have to strike a balance between guaranteeing workplace decorum and creating a cheerful environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-risks-of-holiday-events"><strong>Key Risks of Holiday Events</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Alcohol-Related Misconduct:</strong> Serving alcohol can skew judgment and raise the possibility of inappropriate actions. According to a poll, 57% of workers have seen coworkers drunk during <strong>corporate event planning</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Harassment and Discrimination:</strong> These issues can arise when employees disregard workplace policies, especially in informal settings.</li>



<li><strong>Legal Liability:</strong> Since these are regarded as extensions of the workplace, employers could be liable for activities carried out during events sponsored by their companies.</li>



<li><strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> Misconduct can compromise a corporation&#8217;s image, both inside and outside, influencing public opinion and employee trust.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implementing-event-security-measures-to-prevent-employee-misconduct"><strong>Implementing Event Security Measures to Prevent Employee Misconduct</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Employee behavior management</strong> during events can compromise safety, cause disruptions to business, and damage reputations. Reducing these dangers depends critically on strong event security policies. Businesses may build a safe workplace that discourages misbehavior, guarantees compliance, and advances professionalism by aggressively addressing possible weaknesses. These techniques build the basis for great events by protecting attendees and organizational integrity.</p>



<p><strong>Establish Clear Policies and Communicate Them Effectively</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Pre-event correspondence:</strong> Remind staff members that <strong>workplace professionalism</strong> must be upheld during the event. Reinforce behavioral standards in emails, posters, or quick meetings.</li>



<li><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Share a code of conduct unique to holiday parties that outlines forbidden actions and penalties</li>



<li><strong>Pre-event correspondence:</strong> Remind staff members that <strong>workplace professionalism</strong> must be upheld during the event. Reinforce behavioral standards in emails, posters, or quick meetings.</li>



<li><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Share a code of conduct unique to holiday parties that outlines forbidden actions and penalties.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Alcohol Management Strategies</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Limit Availability:</strong> Set a limit on the alcohol consumption per person or offer drink tickets.</li>



<li><strong>Hire Professional Bartenders</strong>: Make sure bartenders are qualified to spot drunkenness and stop serving when called for.</li>



<li><strong>Present Alternatives:</strong> Offer a range of non-alcoholic drinks and plenty of food to help to prevent excessive drinking.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Monitor Employee Behavior Discreetly</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Assign Oversight Teams:</strong> Assign certain supervisors to oversee the event; make sure they have graceful handling of problems.</li>



<li><strong>Anonymous Reporting:</strong> Through a dedicated hotline or mobile app, inspire staff members to report issues without thinking about reprisals.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Enhance Physical Security</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Venue Selection</strong>: Select locations with appropriate safety precautionsâ€”security guards, emergency exits, and where first aid is present.</li>



<li><strong>Access control: </strong>Limit event access to staff members and invited visitors to stop unwelcome guests from creating disturbance.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planning-inclusive-and-safe-corporate-holiday-parties"><strong>Planning Inclusive and Safe Corporate Holiday Parties</strong></h2>



<p>Successful holiday celebrations reflecting company values depend on inclusion and safety.</p>

</ul>



<p><strong>Voluntary Participation</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Workers should be motivated but not under obligation to attend holiday celebrations. This lessens possible unpleasantness for individuals with different values or personal obligations.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-managing-post-event-follow-up"><strong>Managing Post-Event Follow-Up</strong></h2>



<p>Preventive efforts can inevitably lead to events, so quick resolution is crucial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) started a new corporate whistleblower test program on August 1, 2024. The goal of the program is to make businesses more open and responsible. This program is meant to get people to report wrongdoing at work by giving them money if they do. People who give information can then lose a lot of money and be successfully prosecuted.</p>



<p>The Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section of the DOJ is in charge of the program, which will last for three years. If it works, the DOJ may make changes or add to it. The main goal of the program is to improve white-collar crime prosecution by filling in gaps in present whistleblower systems. Companies need to be aware of this new development and make sure that their investigations at work follow the new rules.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-corporate-whistleblower-program-works"><strong>How the Corporate </strong><strong>Whistleblower</strong><strong> Program Works?</strong></h2>



<p>The DOJâ€™s corporate whistleblower program provides whistleblowers with an opportunity to earn monetary rewards for information that leads to criminal or civil enforcement actions. The program covers cases where a whistleblowerâ€™s tip results in forfeitures exceeding $1,000,000. The potential awards are substantial, offering up to 30% of the first $100 million in penalties collected and 5% of additional penalties, up to $500 million.</p>



<p>This financial incentive could increase whistleblower complaints being made directly to the DOJ or through internal company channels. Companies receiving such complaints should act quickly. They have 120 days to self-report any issues brought up by internal whistleblowers to remain eligible for more favorable treatment, such as a potential declination of prosecution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lauth-investigations-international-ensuring-compliance-and-effective-investigations"><strong>Lauth Investigations International: </strong><strong>Ensuring</strong><strong> Compliance and Effective Investigations</strong></h2>



<p>Partnering with Lauth Investigations International can help companies meet the strict federal, state, and local regulations governing workplace investigations. Lauth Investigations is known for its expertise in investigating issues like whistleblower protection, threat &amp; violence, and other sensitive workplace matters. By leveraging their services, companies can ensure they remain fully compliant with Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws and other relevant regulations.</p>



<p>With Lauth Investigations on your side, companies can implement thorough workplace investigations that protect the rights of employees while safeguarding the company from potential legal risks. Their expertise in handling investigations related to whistleblower protection helps ensure that any reports of misconduct are addressed quickly and effectively, providing peace of mind for both employees and employers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-companies-need-a-strong-whistleblower-program"><strong>Why</strong><strong> Companies Need a Strong Whistleblower Program?</strong></h2>



<p>The DOJ&#8217;s new corporate whistleblower program adds more pressure on companies to have a solid whistleblower policy in place. A well-structured program allows employees to report misconduct anonymously, providing a safe and non-retaliatory environment. To comply with DOJ guidance, organizations must focus on four key areas:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Effective Reporting Mechanisms: </strong>Employees should be able to report anonymously or confidentially without fear of retaliation.</li>



<li><strong>Properly Scoped Investigations: </strong>Investigations should be conducted by qualified professionals to ensure fairness and thoroughness.</li>



<li><strong>Investigation Response: </strong>Organizations must act swiftly after receiving complaints and take appropriate corrective measures.</li>



<li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Companies should allocate adequate resources for investigating complaints and tracking the outcomes to ensure no issues are overlooked.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enhancing-whistleblower-programs-with-lauth-investigations"><strong>Enhancing Whistleblower Programs with Lauth Investigations</strong></h2>



<p>To comply with the DOJâ€™s new whistleblower program, companies need to enhance their current whistleblower policies. This involves setting up reporting mechanisms, such as hotlines, and training employees on how to use them. By partnering with Lauth Investigations International, companies can ensure their whistleblower programs are compliant and effective.</p>



<p>Lauth Investigations helps companies develop whistleblower programs that include clear policies on whistleblower protection and ensure employees know how to report misconduct safely. They also assist in creating a company culture that encourages transparency and supports employees who come forward with important information.</p>



<p>The DOJâ€™s new corporate whistleblower pilot program marks a significant step in encouraging transparency and accountability within corporate America. As the government continues to provide financial rewards to whistleblowers, companies must be prepared to handle an increase in workplace investigations. Failure to address whistleblower complaints adequately could lead to legal challenges and damage to a companyâ€™s reputation.</p>



<p>By partnering with Lauth Investigations International, companies can ensure they comply with the new DOJ program, protect their employees, and uphold a culture of integrity. Lauth Investigations offers comprehensive investigation services to address whistleblower complaints, ensuring companies meet all federal and local requirements.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Found yourself in a confrontation with a colleague in the workplace? How well did this incident settle with you, and what strategies did both parties use to solve the problem? These are the kinds of questions that immediately come to mind whenever workplace violence is mentioned. How best to approach such type of squabble in the place of work mitigates the loss of productive hours, and it is the responsibility of the human resource department to segment appropriate measures of abating disputes that would result in violence. As an HR director, understanding the psychology around workplace violence is not just a necessity but a mandate for safeguarding the workforce and cultivating a culture of safety. It is also a chance to appreciate that human beings are different; therefore, studying individual behavior would significantly help in dealing with the workforce, helping them where necessary. Join me as we discuss the intricacies of human behavior and prevention and intervention strategies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-landscape-of-workplace-violence">The Landscape of Workplace Violence</h2>



<p>Before we discuss the integrities of workplace violence, it is paramount to comprehend the situation of the matter and how it has been entrenched into the working environment. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)</a>, workplace violence affects a considerable number of workers in the United States. These abuses span across different spectrums, including physical abuse, verbal abuse and harassment, and homicides. In the same vein, the effect is shown to affect all demographics, raising the question of whether the human resources professional are trained and equipped to deal with such hurdles.</p>



<p>Statistic further paints a sobering picture- that <a href="https://centerstone.org/our-resources/health-wellness/workplace-violence/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%2017%25%20of%20workplace,what%20exactly%20causes%20this%20phenomenon.">17% of workplace deaths are as a result of violence</a>. Most of the reported cases are from the healthcare, social assistance sector, retail and accounting sectors. This is because the sectors above involve high interaction with individuals, exposing the workers to different characters. Notably, workplace violence permeates all industries, underscoring the need to have proper measures to deal with the menace. As a start, an organization can embrace threat assessment done by Lauth to save both lives and money.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-perpetrator">Understanding the Perpetrator</h2>



<p>At the center of workplace violence lies personal psychology and environmental triggers. As opposed to the popular belief, perpetrators of workplace violence cannot be easily identified as outcasts. They are people within the workplace who may have succumbed to individual and professional pressures. Consider a case of an employee who has faced setbacks in the place of work, combined with personal stress. While the employees might contain themselves and not show any sign of stress, the outburst can disrupt the tranquility of the working environment. This highlights the interrelated nature of workplace violence. It is a product of psychological distress that should be addressed before causing problems at the place of work. Factors such as financial challenges, untreated mental issues, job dissatisfaction, and substance abuse can cause the problem, converting an ordinary person into a threat.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-role-of-intelligence-investigation">The Role of Intelligence Investigation</h2>



<p>In organizations with eminent potential for violence, proactive measures are necessary. While it is true that human resource directors have less training in establishing the possibility of violence in their place of work, this cannot be left as it is. The changing dynamics of workplaces demand innovation and always staying ahead of threats. One of the approaches to avert violence is conducting an intelligence investigation, which is the arsenal of the HR director. This includes analyzing data from different sources, such as employees&#8217; behavior, and external assessment, which enable the identification of threats before escalating into violence.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/Law-Enforcement/Criminal_Intelligence_for_Analysts.pdf">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a> study established that the role of intelligence investigation is to gather information and understand its relationship with other variables. Also, the study noted that intelligence investigation entails piecing up information and coming up with practical applications in the workplace to avert the dangers associated with violence. With this in mind, the importance of intelligence investigation cannot be overstated. Lauth&#8217;s threat assessment team will provide you with the crucial context you need to protect your employees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fostering-a-culture-of-prevention">Fostering a Culture of Prevention</h2>



<p>The evolving nature of work must be addressed, and it is the HR director&#8217;s responsibility to cultivate a culture of prevention. How do we ensure that your workplace has the right culture of protection? It all starts with the most straightforward thing- communication. Supporting open communication motivates the employees to report any form of threat before it escalates into violence. A sustainable organization gives staff in the lowest rank the ability to report cases of threat without intimidation and guarantees them protection. Also, training employees on stress management and de-escalation strategies will ensure the safety of the workers. If you suspect your workers are suffering in silence, consider involving Lauth&#8217;s services, and we shall conduct a comprehensive background check to unearth what you don&#8217;t know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>As an HR director, ensure employees&#8217; safety extends beyond policies and standards. Understanding the behavior of your employees is the starting point for designing appropriate interventions. Also, unraveling workplace violence and leveraging intelligence investigation tools would aid in navigating the challenges of risk. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, &#8220;<em>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; Let us act on this wisdom and ensure that workplace violence ceases to become a statistic but something of the past.</p>

<p>It is intimidating when an employee hears that they are being investigated. This activity should follow due-process, following established procedures that ensure fairness for all parties involved. Employee investigation is a paramount aspect of maintaining a healthy and productive workforce. Investigations are conducted to unearth several issues, such as discrimination, harassment, theft, fraud, and violation of company policies.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>However, following the ethical and legal issues inherent to investigations requires best practice. In this article, we shall explore the complexities surrounding workplace investigations and the ethical and legal challenges the organizations face, and provide insight into possible ways of dealing with these hurdles.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Importance of Employee Investigations</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Although perceived as an intrusive method, employee investigation is vital for an organization to safeguard the integrity, employees&#8217; rights, and ensure fairness and equality. According to a survey by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, organizations lose about 5% of their annual revenue to fraud and theft, underscoring the importance of conducting investigations. This data shows the financial impact that employee misconduct can have on the business, which is why a thorough investigation is needed to mitigate such risks. Our genealogical investigation services focus primarily on proving familial relationships and heirship through documentation in matters of estate, probate, or other financial circumstances, which gives you a chance to partner with us.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Legal Considerations</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Investigation of employees require planning. There is a legal framework under which it should be conducted to ensure compliance, fairness, and protection of employees&#8217; rights. We don&#8217;t anticipate scenarios where a human resource director just set up an employee for investigation due to personal issues of their own. Failure to navigate this legal pitfall exposes an organization to legal battles and possible reputational damage.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>One critical legal consideration is sustaining confidentiality during the process of investigation. Since investigators access huge tracts of data both for organization and employees, protecting this sensitive information and respecting privacy are essential. A breach of confidentiality can result in lawsuits concerning privacy. Have a confidentiality policy emphasizing protecting sensitive information during employee investigation.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Another important consideration is that any employee&#8217;s investigation process should be impartial and prompt. Discrimination against an employee included in the investigation is a violation which is punishable within the local laws, and can result in negative consequences for an organization. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission highlighted that discrimination and retaliation charges accounted for 55.8% of all charges reported in the year 2023, underscoring the importance of fairness throughout the investigation process.</p>

<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ethical Dilemmas</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Investigation of employees faces ethical dilemmas, which an organization must deal with. One such dilemma is ensuring transparency while simultaneously wanting to protect the confidentiality of information. It is within workers&#8217; rights to know the outcome of the investigation to which they have been subjected, but disclosing the affected person&#8217;s information compromises their privacy. This is a skinny rope to tread on, and having the right advice from experts such as Lauth&#8217;s legal team would expose you to boundaries beyond which you cannot pass.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Another ethical dilemma is ensuring that investigations are conducted in an unbiased manner. This requires engaging investigators who are trained to remain neutral and objective to the core duty. However, unconscious bias can still influence the decision, resulting in an unfair outcome. Diversity and inclusion training would lessen the biases of investigators.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Practices for Navigating Legal and Ethical Challenges</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>To effectively deal with the problem of legal and ethical difficulties in employee investigations, the following best practices can be adopted by your organization:</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:list -->
<ul><!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>Develop a comprehensive guideline of how the investigation should be done, detailing the requirements for every step.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item -->

<!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>Train the investigators on legal requirements, interviewing techniques, and ethical standards.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item -->

<!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>Maintain the confidentiality of all information of the involved parties and refrain from discussing the outcome of the investigation with the unapproved person.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item -->

<!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>Communicate the process and outcome of the investigation to employees to cultivate trust.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item -->

<!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>After the conclusion of the investigation, follow up with the necessary disciplinary action required, and implement corrective measures to prevent a recurrence.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /divi:list -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Employee investigation is a complex process that requires careful consideration of legal and ethical obligations. However, ensuring fairness and transparency in this process helps an organization achieve the intended objective, thus raising a culture of accountability. Through proactive measures and a commitment to ethical conduct, organizations can safeguard their reputation, protect employees&#8217; rights, and maintain trust and credibility.</p>

<p>Picture this: a workplace where employees feel respected, safe, and valued. Sounds good, right! Unfortunately, this is not always an ideal situation. The study by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revealed that workplace violence affects about 2 million people every year in the United States alone. These figures may be scary and mitigate your determination to conduct business. Fear not, as there are well-proven strategies that you can implement to safeguard your employees and organization. This article will discuss five effective methods to create a working environment where safety reigns supreme.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Comprehensive Prevention Policy</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine a castle without robust walls; it will be prone to attacks. Similarly, the organization and employees are at risk without a workable prevention policy in the workplace. Policies are internally created and customized to fit the nature of your business. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all policies, as different organizations engage in activities with varied levels of risk. Studies have shown that workplaces with clear violence policies report lower incidences. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine indicates that companies with violence policies experience 40% fewer cases than those without such guidelines.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The policy should define terms such as harassment, verbal abuse, and physical violence, which employees experience in the workplace. Notably, this policy document should also clearly indicate the reporting procedure, the disciplinary action to be taken, and the supportive mechanism for the victims. While some human resource directors might consider this a lot of work, it improves productivity. We, as Lauth, will conduct a proper violence assessment to give you insight into how well-prepared you are for incidences of violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Training and Creating Awareness among the Employees</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is self-fulfilling for a business owner to have a vigilant team that can detect threats. Employee training equips them with the necessary skills, such as interpersonal skills and conflict management, which makes them handle issues that could result in violence. The leading cause of violence within the workplace is a lack of understanding among the workforce, and appreciating diversity lessens violence. Investing in training saves time that could have been used to solve the conflict. For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) study showed that companies that invested in workplace violence training experienced a 70% reduction in workplace violence. Arm your team with knowledge!</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting Rigorous Risk Assessment</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps you cannot perceive the inherent risk that violence can bring to your business because it has never happened. Or better put, take into consideration an employee who gets injured while at work due to an incidence of violence, such as a physical altercation. Picture that regarding litigations related to work injury benefit claims, and I am sure you will appreciate the need to fortify your defense. A regular risk assessment identifies the vulnerabilities within your business. Through our experienced risk assessment investigator, we identify weak points in your system and provide a comprehensive report on improvements.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing Workplace Violence Prevention Teams</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Having a dedicated team of guardians for preventing workplace violence is the best thing you can gift your business this year. This team is instrumental in ensuring petty issues resulting from violence are handled out immediately before they escalate. A small problem, such as miscommunication, can snowball into physical or verbal abuse. It is prudent to establish a workplace violence prevention team consisting of experts from different departments, and their primary role would be to develop and implement violence prevention strategies.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:image {"id":165943,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="545" height="558" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2.png" alt="Proactive Strategies for Preventing Workplace Violence" class="wp-image-165943" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2.png 545w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2-480x491.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 545px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Organizations with a workable workplace violence prevention team are good at establishing potential threats before they happen. This is supported by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), which indicated that 80% of the companies with violence prevention teams reported a decrease in workplace violence incidences. As a starting point, develop a violence prevention team and track the cases within the first year. The outcome will be appealing, and for you to achieve this, we suggest helping you with a corporate culture audit to serve as a mirror of exactly how prepared you are in regard to workplace violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting a Culture of Respect and Support</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Build solidarity among your employees. Being united is a compact pillar in mitigating violence in the workplace. Successful organizations foster a culture of respect and support, which essentially prevents violence in the workforce. This is because the employees feel valued, and they tend to propagate the value of respect to the advantage of the business. How do you cultivate a culture of support and respect? This happens through encouraging open communication and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination. These approaches create a sense of belonging, preventing conflict from escalating into violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is undeniably true that workplace violence impedes an organization&#8217;s growth and lowers productivity. As the workforce continues to become more diverse, the chances of conflicts, hence violence, would continue in the workplace. Therefore, it is wrong to sit and wait until an incident happens in order to act. This article has highlighted the different strategies you can adopt for your enterprise and stand out in averting the repercussions that tag along with violence. Lauth can help you with your violence assessment, risk assessment, and corporate audit to mitigate violence.</p>

<p>In the modern way of doing business, fostering a working environment of respect, inclusivity, and diversity is not only a requirement but a legal mandate. This has happened due to the changing market dynamics, where the world is now a global village. Interconnectedness has increased, and therefore, there is a need to enhance cultural respect. However, harassment and discrimination continue to be a pervasive issue, derailing the morale of the workers and also limiting organizational growth.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>To deal with these challenges effectively, an organization is supposed to employ proactive strategies that ensure equality and respect. The actionable steps discussed in this article would benefit a business that wants to avert the challenges of harassment and discrimination in the workplace and improve productivity.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Latitude of the problem</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Before engaging ourselves in actual steps that can be used to deal with harassment and discrimination, it is paramount to understand the prevalence and impact of the issue. According to the report released by the Employment Opportunity Commission (EOC), it was noted that about 33% of the cases reported to them related to workplace harassment. It also informs that the highest form of discrimination is centered on race, gender, age, and disability.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>This shows a problem; we cannot hide our heads under the sand and assume everything is okay. Human resource directors have a role to play, especially in the present era, where penetration of technology has allowed a diverse workforce, which is a trigger to discrimination and harassment.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting Awareness through Training</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Employees might lack the proper knowledge regarding the harm they bring to an organization through discrimination and harassment. On equal measure, the executives charged with the mandates of upholding the company&#8217;s integrity might fail to comprehend how a simple act of favoritism has on corporate culture. This lack of information is what training on harassment and discrimination comes to fill.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The workforce is taught how to relate with each other and work as a team, and the overall impact on the organization&#8217;s success. The training can be executed through workshops and scenario-based simulations. In that regard, a human resource director needs to fully understand the nature of the culture in the workplace by conducting a corporate culture audit, a service well executed by Lauth&#8217;s team of experts. Our private investigators are trained to move unseen; therefore, the report you get reflects the actual situation of your workplace regarding harassment and discrimination.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:image {"id":165937,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="979" height="650" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/preventing2.png" alt="Preventing Workplace Harassment and Discrimination." class="wp-image-165937" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/preventing2.png 979w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/preventing2-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 979px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Clear Policies and Procedures</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Why do some workers face stressful levels of harassment and discrimination in the working environment with all levels of management? It is astonishing to note that even large multinationals have reported cases of discrimination and harassment. This, therefore, leaves us with the question of how the small and medium businesses are, where we expect the formality to be ignored. The single answer to this is the lack of an anti-harassment policy; if it is there, it is just a document to show compliance and is less discussed in departmental meetings.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Research by the International Labour Organization (ILO) established that companies with anti-harassment policies are more likely to effectively deal with issues of workplace harassment. This is because the policy defines the process of reporting, dealing with disciplinary cases, and handling the affected person. One of the examples where this policy has worked is at Walmart. The retailer strengthened its anti-harassment policy by enforcing zero-tolerance to harassment. We know the employees might fear reporting harassment and discrimination cases to human resource office. Lauth has a dedicated hotline that you can leverage, and we do the investigation work for you as you concentrate on other duties.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fostering a Culture of Accountability</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Leaders play a pivotal role in swaying the behavior of the workers. The manager, departmental heads, and those in supervisory roles are responsible for upholding the organizational culture, which sets the tone of acceptable behavior. As a human resource director, you are the organization&#8217;s engine, and the employeesâ€™ character dictates who you are. In that regard, holding yourself accountable for upholding positive values and inclusivity is beneficial. Set the agenda of zero discrimination or harassment in the workplace from day one when a new employee is hired. This would eventually cascade and be held as the culture of the organization.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>One way to ensure accountability is conducting a targeted recruitment. This involves assessing the workplace environment and identifying areas and unbalanced skills that need more stability. This would ensure that minority groups are included and expand the talent pool across. This has an overall effect of mitigating turnover and improving employeesâ€™ satisfaction.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Combating harassment and discrimination requires different approaches, as discussed above. Similarly, an organization must prioritize a culture of inclusivity and respect since it creates a supportive working environment. This means that the human resource department has a critical responsibility to understand the weaknesses and strengths in their culture to institute necessary remedies. Together, we contribute towards a working environment where every worker feels respected and valued.</p>

<p>Every decision carries a potential consequence. This statement is true even for organizations, and they have to be cautious in every process that constitutes operations. In today&#8217;s dynamic business landscape, digital technology is advancing, and businesses must take care of the risk inherent to hiring and vendor selection. To embrace diversity, enterprises are appreciating the role of cultural amalgamation, attracting people of different characters, skills and qualifications. This is where due diligence acts as a shield against unforeseen risks.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Risk management is elemental for organizations that want to progress in the evolving market environment. As such, the best way to lessen risks is to start from the bottom- understanding the nature of employees and vendors before they become part of your organization. We unveil the power of due diligence and why a human resource director should embrace it.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding Due Diligence</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Due diligence involves in-depth research and investigation, usually conducted by an organization, before agreeing with an employee or vendor. This is the most crucial stage for every organization, as it determines the efficiency of the contract entered into. This process is detailed and entails gathering information, analyzing the data, interpreting it, and verifying the information presented. As lengthy as it may appear, this is a very instrumental chain, as it guides informed decision-making, mitigating the risks. By conducting due diligence, parties&#8217; interests and any problem that can be experienced in the future are protected.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Imperative of Due Diligence in Hiring</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Why, then, is it essential to conduct due diligence in hiring? Statistics reveal that bad hires are a cost for any business. Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) noted that bad hires constitute about five times the position&#8217;s annual salary. This is mind-blowing to any human resource director tasked with ensuring the workforce is skilled enough to benefit the company. Through due diligence, it would be easier to mitigate the risk of bad hires. This cost is incurred in recruitment, training, lost productivity, and legal fees.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Also, conducting due diligence in hiring ensures regulatory compliance. It is equally a requirement for human resource directors to ensure that they comply with the employment local laws, regulations, and standards when hiring. We are in an era marked with stringent local rules regarding the employment process, and due diligence has become mandatory. Failing to understand the actual qualifications and credentials of the candidate can expose the company to legal battles and tarnish its reputation. For instance, hiring a candidate with a history of fraud or ethical delinquency in highly regulated industries such as finance and health care attracts fines or license revocation. Lauth&#8217;s investigative team can unearth the questionable background of your new hires to cut on this cost.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging Due Diligence in Vendor Selection</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Vendor services involve entrusting part of the business operations to an external entity, making the organization prone to fraud. One essential purpose of due diligence is to safeguard against these fraudulent activities. With a proper background check, an organization can avoid getting into the loop of deceptive vendors, which can compromise the supply chain&#8217;s integrity, and thus losing customer trust. A case in point is the Enron Scandal, where the failure of the company to conduct due diligence resulted in huge financial loss. Association with the fraudulent vendor contributed to financial loss and triggered corporate governance reforms globally. A simple step of ensuring you know your vendor can save your organization from such.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The primary duty of a vendor is to support an organization in running smoothly and ensuring efficiency. Due diligence evaluates the vendor&#8217;s financial stability and capability to take that role. We live when global economies are uncertain and market fluctuations are evident. Due diligence, therefore, gives an overview of the vendor&#8217;s financial health, risk exposure, and solvency to reduce the risk of disrupting the supply chain management.</p>

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Practices for Effective Due Diligence</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Embracing technology is the best way to remain ahead regarding due diligence and get the desired results. It is elemental for your organization to invest in modern technologies, such as the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics, to uncover facts that manual operation cannot. Also, this should be coupled with collaboration and information sharing. Collaborating with peer industries, regulatory bodies, and professional bodies can allow access to databases to learn more about the candidates. One such valuable entity is Lauth, and we pride ourselves on using verified databases to secure a comprehensive background report on the relevant Subjects in the case.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>That said, due diligence is not a one-time thing. An organization should implement systems for continuous monitoring. This is because information is not static, and the vendor&#8217;s details might change along the way. Thus, it is essential to keep track of records to adapt to evolving risks.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Risk prowls at every corner, and the beacon of assurance that organizations can rely upon is conducting due diligence. Whether during the hiring process or selecting a vendor, due diligence remains the pillar of hope, safeguarding the organization&#8217;s reputation and interest. Embracing these due diligence principles and integrating them into decision-making gives an organization the resilience and confidence to navigate turbulent waters. Don&#8217;t stress; our investigators have the necessary tool chest to conduct objective, covert undercover operations to unearth misconduct among the hires and vendors.</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s hyperconnected world, safeguarding your business from pervasive workplace theft and fraud is inevitable, and demands a multifaceted approach. Enterprises are increasingly grappling with the metamorphosis of criminal tactics and the advancement of technology. These trends are a danger to any surviving business and require well-thought-out approaches to mitigate losses. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), organizations lose about 5% of their total revenue through fraud, which amounts to trillion dollars annually. This loss goes beyond financial, to damage of trust by customers, dented reputation, and legal ramifications.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure your workplace is protected from these threats, it is paramount to institute solid strategies that address vulnerabilities across the business- policies, employee awareness, organization culture, and policies. Let&#8217;s delve into methods that you can employ to prevent theft and fraud in your industry.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Culture of Integrity</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is essential to understand that a business is as good as its employees. This means that if the workforce is morally corrupted, this is reflected in your business, and the chances of making losses are high. Cultivating a culture of integrity is the foundation of dealing with fraud, and this has been supported by past research showing that institutions with high integrity culture experience less fraud. Does this resonate with you? Well, let&#8217;s look at the case of Wells Fargo, a financial institution embroiled in a scandal of fraudulent account openings. Due to the aggressive sales culture of the company, it incentivized employees to achieve unrealistic targets. This misconduct of wanting to achieve short-term gains damaged the company&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>A simple act of failing to act ethically can ruin your years of investment, a pitfall that businesses should avoid. This can happen by supporting workforce accountability, transparency, and honesty. As a human resource director, you are responsible for encouraging an open form of communication where employees can report any theft or fraudulent activities without fear. For you to effectively implement these, it is essential that you understand the nature of your corporate culture, and Lauth has seasoned experts in conducting corporate culture audits. We will ensure that the findings of the audit capture the weaknesses and provide workable recommendations.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting Thorough Background Checks</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Trust but verify.&#8221; This adage should prevail when hiring new employees. Conducting a thorough background check is vital in identifying the red flags and mitigating the risk. The data released by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) alludes that about one-third of job applicants provide false information on their resumes. This should scare you as a human resource director. Consider the Enron Energy Company case, deemed one of the heinous accounting frauds in history that led to its demise. If the company had conducted proper background checks on the executive, they might have uncovered the unethical behavior.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:image {"id":165934,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="908" height="438" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2.png" alt="Background checks at the workplace" class="wp-image-165934" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2.png 908w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2-480x232.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 908px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The rule of thumb is a background check is essential to prevent internal fraud and theft, which could potentially cripple your business. Most human resource directors need to pay more attention to this stage, as it is perceived to waste time. It&#8217;s understandable, but we must find a way to dispel the fact that such a process can be outsourced. Our private investigators are experienced in conducting comprehensive background checks and providing objective details that would save your company in the future.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Stringent Access Controls</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>We must uphold the importance of securing business&#8217;s information and critical data. Insider threats account for a high percentage of fraud incidents, emphasizing the significance of having strong access control. To avoid data breaches, it is imperative to implement pin codes, biometric scanners, and keycards since they are important tools for identifying and monitoring the activities of employees within the place of work.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Are all these stringent measures effective? The answer to this question might differ depending on whether your business has experienced a case of fraud or theft. However, it has been proven that establishing access control at the cash office prevents theft. This is because all log trails are left behind, and any theft can be traced to a specific employee. You need to know the source to mitigate. That&#8217;s why the fraud investigation service is elemental for your company.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Surveillance and Monitoring Systems</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Deploying surveillance cameras and monitoring systems could be a step towards mitigating theft and fraud in the workplace. While it might intimidate the workers, it is a security awareness strategy. The study conducted by the University of North Carolina showed that cameras reduce theft and fraud by 51%. For example, in the retail sector, video analytics software can detect activities such as shoplifting and provide real-time information to security personnel to act. Now that our most excellent tool at Lauth is risk assessment, we can offer guidelines on where you could be missing regarding surveillance and monitoring. Secure your investment!</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Safeguarding your business against theft and fraud needs a comprehensive approach, requiring you to examine your organization&#8217;s culture, existing policies, available technology, and employees&#8217; awareness. Organizations can curb theft and fraud by implementing a culture of integrity, conducting background checks, implementing access control, and ensuring surveillance and monitoring systems. These protect your reputation and assets and uphold the culture of accountability. Lauth&#8217;s investigative services chip in to supplement your organizationâ€™s operational safety.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="676" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/workplaceinvestigations-1024x676.png" alt="workplace investigations" class="wp-image-160985" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/workplaceinvestigations-980x647.png 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/workplaceinvestigations-480x317.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-investigations/"><strong>Workplace investigations</strong> </a>should be conducted periodically to ensure that crimes are not going unnoticed within organizations. A thorough <strong>workplace investigation</strong> can help uncover many types of crimes, from harassment, discrimination, and forgery to theft. A workplace<strong> investigation </strong>is a process through which an organization uncovers and discovers facts about complaints related to misconduct, violence, harassment, theft, and other issues. Although the procedures and policies for <strong>workplace investigations</strong> vary from one organization to another, there are certain standard practices.Â </p>



<p><strong>1.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Ensure confidentiality during investigations</strong>.</p>



<p>You and your <strong>human resource</strong> team conducting <strong>workplace investigations</strong> must ensure the complete confidentiality of all the parties involved, including the complainant, suspect, and witnesses. When you assure these people that you wonâ€™t be sharing their side of the story with anyone except when necessary, they will be encouraged to reveal all they know about the case without fearing retribution or being judged. And, of course, this will be the perfect opportunity for you and your investigators to get the right story and evidence needed to make a final decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Review documentation</strong></p>



<p>As an employer, you and your <strong>HR investigators</strong> will make a huge mistake in corporate investigations if you rely strictly on stories the parties involved recount. While it is a good idea to grant interviews to all involved to hear their sides of the story, it will be irrational of you to focus on just their words. Instead, you need to review all documented evidence, such as recordings, messages, pictures, or emails, for clarity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Get an experienced investigator</strong>.</p>



<p>For a <strong>workplace investigation</strong> to be effective, you must work with an experienced investigator with a vast understanding of all the applicable laws associated with an internal inquiry. Itâ€™s up to you to choose an internal or <strong>private investigator for corporate investigations</strong> to help with the case. Whatever you decide, your goal should be to get someone who will use his comprehensive knowledge of laws and regulations to conduct thorough investigations while avoiding possible legal complications along the way. Rest assured that with an expert investigator on your team, you will be more confident in resolving the issue efficiently while adhering to your organizationâ€™s protocols and cultures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are, however, several ways through which you and your investigation team can determine if your employees have committed previous crimes;</p>



<p><strong>1.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Conduct interviews</strong></p>



<p>During a <strong>workplace investigation</strong>, it is possible to discover the past criminal records of your employees through information obtained from interviews. This is why conducting as many interviews as possible with as many witnesses as possible, or people you believe can give you more details on the issue is crucial. Of course, you must ask follow-up questions during interviews to get more background information about the employees involved. However, remember to schedule interviews at the right times to maintain the day-to-day activities of your employees. In addition, ensure that all interviews are conducted privately, without bias.</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Investigate previous criminal history</strong>.</p>



<p>It would also help if you and the investigation team investigated the previous criminal history of the suspect. To successfully do this, you must understand and familiarize yourself with the applicable laws of your state. Some of the best ways of carrying out previous investigations on criminal history involve searching online public records or requesting background information through court clerks. Nevertheless, to be safe, it is better to do all criminal checks even before hiring your employees. This will help you avoid recruiting people with criminal histories.</p>



<p><strong>3.</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Collect the relevant documents</strong>.</p>



<p>It is of the utmost importance to collect documents and evidence that can help you point out the wrongdoings of your employees during a <strong>corporate investigation</strong>. Documents, including emails, text messages, and social media messages, can help you uncover many things. Similarly, pieces of evidence, including footage from security cameras, videos, photos, and other expense reports, can help you uncover other previous criminal activities of your employees. It will help if you collect all such evidence, even if you arenâ€™t sure they will be helpful. You can always pass them to a <strong>private investigator</strong> who will use them with other materials at hand to create a complete picture of the situation.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-yan-krukau-7640829-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-160972" srcset="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-yan-krukau-7640829-980x653.jpg 980w, https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-yan-krukau-7640829-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p>Most organizations are increasingly experiencing violations from their employees, and when necessary, a workplace investigation must be conducted. Even though some violations are more severe than others, they can harm the employee and the organization. They can be broadly classified under three major categories;</p>



<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Routine violation</strong></p>



<p>A routine violation occurs when employees break the routines recommended for daily activities.Â  Most employees indulge in routine violations to save energy and time. They often believe that following the designated safety rules will slow them down. Unfortunately, many employees do not know the risks associated with routine violations when it is the leading cause of accidents and injuries in most workplaces.Â </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2">
<li><strong>Situational violation</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Most employees indulge in situational violations because of sudden pressures at particular times. The right equipment may sometimes prevent employees from violating safety procedures. For example, in the absence of a scaffold, an employee may use a ladder when working at heights. Some employees indulge in situational violations because their jobs are boring and require repetitive tasks. A poor working environment that is cluttered can also increase the prevalence of situational violations from employees.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Exceptional Violation</strong></p>



<p>Exceptional violation often occurs when safety rules are broken to perform a new task or deal with an incidental event, like violations that occur during emergency procedures like explosions and fires. Nevertheless, anger, anxiety, and other emotions can also trigger exceptional violations. Examples of situations of exceptional violation triggered by emotions include sexual harassment, physical violence or threats to violence, spreading false rumors, using obscene language, cyberbullying, and destroying the belongings of a coworker or colleague.Â </p>



<p>However, as an employer, it is your responsibility to conduct <strong>workplace investigations</strong> to uncover current or previous acts of violations by employees. There are many ways to conduct <strong>employee investigations</strong> on violations, but these steps will help you uncover both previous and current cases.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Have a complaint mechanism put in place</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>One of the best ways to help uncover violations in your organization during a <strong>workplace investigation</strong> is to put a complaint mechanism in place. But, you must ensure this mechanism allows employees to give tips anonymously. The truth is that some cases of violation go unnoticed because employees who witnessed them are afraid to come in front and speak. Therefore, you must also sensitize your employees about the existence of such a mechanism and encourage them to send tips on past and current acts of violation they have experienced. By so doing, you would uncover old and recent violation cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Have corporate awareness of what constitutes violation</strong>.</p>



<p>Some employees in organizations are ignorant about some forms of violation. Therefore, it makes sense to include sensitization in your <strong>workplace investigation</strong> plan as an employer. For example, you could seize the opportunity of an existing case of violation to sensitize your employees about all the forms of violation. This will not only help them identify future instances of violation, but some may also remember all the previous instances that went unreported due to ignorance.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Gather evidence and analyze them</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Conducting employee investigations</strong> requires you and the investigation team to act promptly by gathering as much evidence as possible through interviews, emails, photos, videos, and records. Gathering these materials is one thing, and analyzing them correctly is another. You and the investigation team must ask follow-up questions to prove or disprove the complainant. In addition, the evidence gathered during the investigations may be a pointer toward previous acts of violation in your organization. If you get enough evidence that points to an earlier act of violation, you should investigate the matter and take the right actions.Â </p>



<p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Communicate effectively during the investigations</strong>.</p>



<p>Effective communication is crucial to a workplace investigation of violation. If you can communicate effectively with all the parties involved, you will likely extract valuable information that can be useful in uncovering previous and current acts of violation. However, a pro tip for effective communication is to listen carefully to your interviewees and ask them relevant follow-up questions to get as much information as possible. </p>



<p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Provide the complainant with a healthy working environment</strong>.</p>



<p>While <strong>workplace investigations</strong> are ongoing, it would help if you provided the complainant with a healthy working environment. In addition, keeping the complainant safe will encourage him to cooperate with the investigations team for the employees&#8217; overall well-being. Of course, cooperation will include citing past instances of violation and giving suggestions on how to prevent them from recurring.&nbsp;</p>
