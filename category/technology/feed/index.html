<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CCTV Cameras in some major US cities are capturing private citizens’ faces in real-time</strong>.</h2>



<p><a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2018/09/augmented-reality-surveillance-capitalism-21st-century/">Surveillance capitalism</a> in the United States has been steadily evolving in the United States over the last ten years. Since the invention of social media and the rise of ubiquitous outdoor CCTV surveillance systems in major cities, private individuals are becoming more and more visible to anyone who knows where to look, and how to access the images. Now, the announcement that certain American cities are ostensibly planning to install real-time facial recognition software for their external CCTV systems has civil liberty groups in a uproar. </p>



<p>The “authoritarian potential,” as it was denoted in a recent article by WIRED, began in China, with many activist groups condemning the country’s use of facial recognition software to flag suspects who are caught on the cities’ external candid cameras. However, according to WIRED, Georgetown researchers released <a href="https://www.americaunderwatch.com/">a report</a> last week that cities like Chicago and Detroit have purchased this software for their CCTV surveillance systems. In addition to the fact that both cities deny current use of this software, there is no federal or state law that would prevent them from doing so. </p>



<p>The technology is innocuous enough. It’s the same technology that allows personal smart devices like iPhones, desktops, and laptops to have security protocol that prevents someone who is not the user from accessing the device. Image recognition software has been used by law enforcement for years to catch criminals, but experts are saying this level of sophistication in technology can create a troubling landscape in which a private individual’s anonymity in public spaces is threatened—experts like Evan Selinger, a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, “Historically, we haven’t had to regulate privacy in public because it’s been too expensive for any entity to track our whereabouts.” With the rise of a surveillance capitalism, those days are over. </p>



<p>For civil liberty groups, the premise of this software being used to catch criminals does little to overshadow the specter of Big Brother hanging over them. Experts and activists alike call into question the accuracy of the software, and what effect any inaccuracies will have on persons of color and other private, non-suspect individuals who are minding their own business in a public square. They’ve also called attention to the use of such real-time facial recognition systems on police work, saying technological biases in biometric surveillance will lead to flawed investigations, and resources wasted on faulty leads generated by the systems. In one instance, actor Woody Harrelson’s image was uploaded into the system with the intention of identifying potential suspects who resemble him.</p>



<p>It is difficult to ignore the potential good a system like this could do in cases of missing persons or child abduction. CCTV footage is constantly being utilized by law enforcement to recreate a person’s movements in order to find answers—just recently, CCTV footage was used by Houston law enforcement to investigate the claims of a missing 4-year-old’s stepfather, who says she was kidnapped by two men after he was ambushed on the side of the road. He’s now being held on a $45,000 bond after the CCTV footage outside their Houston apartment directly contradicted his story. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the concerns surrounding this evolving real-time facial recognition technology, one thing is certain: Legislature at all levels of government must have an eye on this technology and its capabilities, bearing in mind that misappropriation could have disastrous consequences to private citizens who are innocent of any wrongdoing. &nbsp;Without rules or regulations to dictate how the technology should be used, cities in the United States could become vulnerable to what has been denoted as a potentially authoritarian practice, eroding our privacy, and threatening our liberty. <br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber criminals are evolving at an alarming rate. Cyber-security product developers are on an infinite loop with felons, each trying to out fox the other with regards to data breaches. Security is absolutely necessary for brick and mortar establishments due to a myriad of reasons, but in 2019, the name of the game is cyber-security. Not only are data breaches an efficient <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/brand-protection/">way to steal trade secrets</a> and financial information from businesses, but they can also be done remotely. A proficient hacker or scammer can access a company’s vital company information from halfway across the world, and from that same location, can devastate the company. Within minutes, they can access financial information, trade secrets, distribution and delivery schedules, and private customer information. To prevent this from happening to your business, here are 5 cyber security measures every business should have: </span></p>
<p><b>Iron-clad Passwords </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Internet 101. Since the birth of the World Wide Web, we’ve been educating adults and children alike on the importance of having a strong password to access online accounts. Whether it’s a company’s financial information, or a Grubhub app on an executive’s phone, thieves can crack weak passwords to gain access. As such, it’s important passwords never contain personal information about an individual, especially if that information is visible on social media. Parents often include the name of their kids in their passwords, using their dates of birth for any numerical value requirement. Teens and young adults use the name of their favorite animal, sport, or music artist. Another common tactic is using common words that are easy to remember, and then spelling them backwards for a false sense of security. Experts at the National Cyber Security Alliance also do not recommend using sequences of characters that are near each other on the keyboard, such as “QWERTY,” the first six characters of the keyboard. The current recommended length for strong passwords is between 8-12 characters. If you’re unsure whether or not you password is secure, use an online password checker to verify the passwords level of  cyber security. </span></p>
<p><b>Fortified Firewalls </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firewalls have been around almost as long as passwords. Firewalls are shields that protect your business from harmful or insidious traffic. When you connect to the internet, the system is constantly communicating with the wireless network, both sending and receiving units of information known as packets. Firewalls monitor these packets and perform a risk assessment, blocking unsafe packets. These firewalls protect your company’s data from unauthorized remote access by criminals. </span></p>
<p><b>Antivirus Protection </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roland Cloutier, the Chief Security Officer for ADP, calls antivirus software “the last line of defense” when protecting your company’s data from hackers and other cyber-criminals. Not only can remote criminals access and view a company’s vital information, but they can also install vicious malware that will copy the target’s hard drive, and subsequently render the machine inoperable. Installing anti-virus and anti-malware programs aren’t enough, though. These programs need to be updated regularly as part of the infinite loop mentioned earlier. Every time a criminal finds a way to bypass an anti-malware product, the product requires changes to combat those breaches. </span></p>
<p><b>Laptops and Mobile Phones</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/2019/02/sim-card-swapping-scams-leave-businesses-vulnerable/">secure laptop computers and mobile smartphones</a> associated with your business. For this, experts recommend encryption software so any remote felon attempting to access or copy the hard drive cannot do so without the proper password. They also stress the importance of never leaving these devices in ones vehicle, where they are easily accessible to thieves. “Lock-out” options are also standard for these devices in 2019. This setting allows you to establish a time period during which the phone lies idle. After that period expires, the phone locks itself, preventing anyone from accessing it without the password. Smartphones and laptops with remote-wipe features must be enabled. This way, if your device falls into the wrong hands, you can remotely wipe the device and prevent the leak of sensitive company information. </span></p>
<p><b>Employee Education</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last, but never least, it’s important your workforce is educated on the security measures in place and regularly enforces them on a day-to-day basis. Companies often neglect employee education under the false impression their IT team will be able to resolve all issues whenever they arise. The fact is, even IT professionals cannot anticipate every cyber threat, and may not be up-to-date on the very latest in cyber-criminal tactics. An ounce of this education is worth a pound of cure—Despite the level of technology literacy in the United States in 2019, an employer or business owner cannot assume an employee’s level of security knowledge. The prevention starts with employees, providing them with an intimate knowledge of company operations and how cyber security measures protect them. </span></p>
<p>Regardless of your company&#8217;s industry or size, all businesses must update and maintain their cyber security. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when criminals can bypass cyber security, and devastate a company in minutes.</p><p>The post <a href="https://lauthinvestigations.com/5-cyber-security-measures-every-business/">5 Cyber Security Measures Every Business Needs</a> appeared first on <a href="https://lauthinvestigations.com">Indiana Private Investigators | Lauth Investigations International, Inc.</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1721" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/money-locked.png" alt="money locked" width="724" height="436" />The invention of direct-deposit payments in electronic banking have likely saved companies millions of dollars over the years in labor hours, materials, and fees that previously caused problems for companies. However, in an age where your paycheck is sent automatically to your checking account, phishers are seeking to exploit this automation for personal gain.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service has reported an upswing in various types of fraud that directly target a company’s payroll. While the ruses come in many forms, one of the most popular is phishing emails disguised as legitimate correspondence from an employee or upper management. It’s always an instruction to alter payroll information so that funds would be rerouted to the scammer’s bank account. Once the deed is done, the money is withdrawn and the company is responsible to replace the missing funds. While the FTC and the IRS are constantly reevaluating their strategies for containing these types of fraud, this particular scheme is hard to detect and often goes unreported. The email can outsmart security measures set down by the company or within a company’s email server, and scammers take amounts that can just be written off as unfortunate missteps on behalf of personnel.</p>
<p>Frauds such as these have gone through an evolution as security technology becomes more sophisticated and what we know about internet culture continues to grow. Internet frauds used to be about volume and inattention to detail—thus the birth of phishers, who sent emails rife with spelling and grammar mistakes out to mile-long email lists, casting a wide net throughout the web. Education about fraud has forced scammers to be more cautious. Today, companies who have seen this scam in its newest form remark that these phishing emails look so authentic that there may not be a question in their mind before obliging their request. Security measures that have risen from the nucleus of electronic banking combat wire fraud every day in the United States. Large sums in wire transfers now throw up giant red flags. Phishers and scammers are getting more bang for their buck by taking smaller amounts with more frequency, lurking below the radar. This does not require sophisticated hacking skills. Just the ability to open a Gmail account. Phishers make the account look cosmetically convincing, then throw out the lure. One of the most targeted entities is non-profit organizations, because of the benevolent nature of their business. The idea of someone ripping off a charity or relief organization is horrifying, but the simplicity of scams like this make the opportunity too lucrative to pass up.</p>
<p>It’s frightening how simple the fraud is to pull off, but there is recourse for businesses who are vulnerable to such a scam. One of the non-profits who fell prey to this scam was KVC Health Systems, an agency for child welfare in Kansas City. Their IT director, Erik Nyberg, says it starts with comprehensive education on company procedures, “The CEO is never going to email you out of the blue and ask you for any deposit changes. And if you have any sliver of a doubt, call the person who is making the request.” He goes on to discourage executives and upper management employees from using their personal email accounts to send staff correspondence, and to set email filters that will catch suspicious incoming messages. Social media managers are also cautioned against posting any company information to their pages that could serve to bolster a phisher’s credibility.</p>
<p>If your business has been the target of this wire fraud scam, you are encouraged to report them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx">IC3 tip line</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2020" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SIM-Cards.jpg" alt="sim card swapping" width="924" height="519" /></p>
<p>Smartphones have become such an integral part of our everyday lives that many users joke their devices have become grafted to their hands. We use them to maintain contact in our work and personal lives, correspond through email and social media, and a bulk of Americans have made the transition to conducting their banking through the use of mobile applications. As developers continue their bottomless pursuit to create an app for everything, more and more of our real, flesh-and-blood lives are being stored on our phones: personal details, account numbers, passwords, and other sensitive information that could be misused if it fell into the wrong hands. That’s why smartphone users have to educate themselves on the specifics of a scam called “SIM card swapping.”</p>
<p><strong>What is SMS?</strong></p>
<p>For many telephone, internet, and smart device developers, SMS (short message service) text messaging is the cornerstone of their services. As of 2010, it was the most utilized service provided by communication companies with 3.5 billion users. It became a vital tool in direct marketing campaigns and remains one of the most popular forms of communication in younger users. Because of the ubiquity of smartphones, many companies that require a two-step authentication process for their users’ security implement SMS as a secure means of accessing information. For example, you attempt to log in to your bank account, correctly entering your username and secure password. It’s not uncommon for banking apps to prompt a second form of verification, so the app tells you it will now be sending a four-digit verification code to your phone that you must enter on the app to confirm that you are who you say you are. The code is sent to your phone via SMS. Once this information is transmitted over SMS, users are often derelict in deleting that information from their devices. This is where users are vulnerable to the scam.</p>
<p><strong>How SIM swap scams work</strong></p>
<p>Smartphone users who have lost their phone or who have been the victim of a theft often have the ability to call their mobile provider and provide their secure information in order to have the provider remotely wipe the SIM card and have that information transferred to another phone. Thieves in search of secure information will use tools like phishing mail campaigns, posing as legitimate companies like insurance and credit card companies to get the victim to willingly hand over identifying information such as date of birth, address, and phone number. Once they have enough identifying information, they will call the victim’s mobile provider and pose as a customer. They claim they’ve lost their phone or their phone was stolen from them. Then, using the victim’s identifying information, they will request that the mobile provider remotely wipe their old SIM card and rewrite it to the SIM card in their new device. Just like that, the thief has any and all information that has ever been transmitted via SMS text. This leaves accounts, email inboxes, and secure information vulnerable to fraud. “A high proportion of banking customers now have mobile phone numbers linked with their accounts,” fraud prevention consultant, Emma Mohan-Satta, told Digital Trends, “and so this attack is becoming common in some regions where this attack was not previously so common. Unlike mobile malware, SIM fraud attacks are usually aimed at profitable victims who have been specifically targeted through successful social engineering.”</p>
<p><strong>Who is vulnerable?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who uses their smartphone as part of a two-step authentication is vulnerable to a SIM card swap scam. Once the thief has their hands on your personal information, they can devastate you in minutes by performing bank transfers, rerouting mail, and making purchases in your name. If the SIM card contained any compromising information, such as lewd photos or inappropriate communication with another person, the perpetrators can use that information to blackmail a victim into paying a tidy sum in exchange for the return of the compromising data. A victim named Tina told Motherboard, “This just happened to me over the weekend. I lost service late Saturday night and assumed it was an issue with my always buggy iPhone. Then on Sunday morning my husband got a text from T-Mobile saying that a line on our phone plan had been cancelled (mine) and i soon discovered that $1200 had wired out of my bank account to someone in [redacted] with my same last name.”</p>
<p>While the cost to a single individual can be devastating, a sophisticated thief can do even more to topple a business like a house of cards. It’s common practice for some types of employers to issue their employees a company cell phone to facilitate business, and in this day and age, that almost certainly means a smart phone. Correspondence between coworkers, appointments, account numbers, and sensitive company information can be exposed and exploited for gain. Companies that carry high financial sums in their accounts can be ruined before they even realize there’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>How to protect yourself</strong></p>
<p>Dependence on smart phones to facilitate two-step authentication plagues many users throughout the country who enjoy the convenience of verifying their identity through SMS. Luckily, tech sites like Motherboard recommend a few ways you can protect your identity and your monies.</p>
<p><strong>Beef up account security</strong></p>
<p>Many major cell phone service providers are developing new methods of two-step authentication in light of the rise of SIM card swap scams. Many offer their customers the option to set up a secure PIN for their account, completely separate from the login information used to access their account. The PIN is used as a primary verification feature specifically for when customers call into the support center for SIM card-related issues. Previously, many providers opted for a security question for this type of authentication, but the answers to these security questions can often be found on a victim’s social media, such as, “Which high school did you attend?” This way, the PIN is never transmitted through SMS text messaging, and no personal information from a social media profile can be used against them.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t link your number to your online accounts</strong></p>
<p>Once a thief has access to your account, they can easily reset your password and other authentication methods, making it very difficult to quash the problem. Instead of linking your mobile cell phone to your accounts, you can choose a different sort of number, such as a Google Voice number.</p>
<p>Many individuals and companies bypass security measures for a number of reasons, such as lack of time, interest, or the mere belief that they could never be the victim of a SIM card swapping scam. The reality is that it can happen to anyone, and there’s no shortage of victims for scammers. Users who practice their due-diligence can build a security to block them out. When the scammer hits this wall, they simply move on to the next target. Educate yourself and ensure that target isn’t you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1998" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/videogame_36180671.png" alt="predators online gaming" width="1317" height="349" /></p>
<p>Advances in technology are constantly changing the dialogue about how we protect our children from potential predators. Over the last decade, parents have had to reform their strategy when it comes to protecting their child in the real world. Before, parents cautioned their kids on stranger danger, special code words, and remaining aware of their surroundings in public. In a new era of unfettered internet access through multiple smart devices, parents had to contend with the real world being brought into their homes, with predators targeting their children through social media. Now, it appears parents will yet again have to add some new pages to the playbook when it comes to protecting their children from predators on video game platforms with integrated social networking.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents with children between the ages of 12-25 will likely be familiar with the online first-person shooter video game known as </span><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/buy-now"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortnite</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the game, 100 players at a time compete to be the last one standing in a battle-royale style of combat. The game features a chat feature allowing players to communicate in team efforts and other uses. It has great potential to foster team building and cooperation between young people, but also has a dark side recently illuminated by an arrest made in Florida in late January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities arrested 41-year-old, </span><a href="https://foxillinois.com/news/local/predators-using-popular-video-game-to-lure-children-09-25-2018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony Thomas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a man who allegedly used </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortnite’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instant-messaging feature to groom over 20 minors, including a 17-year-old, with whom law enforcement allege he had a sexual relationship. The Florida Attorney General’s Office also stated Thomas has been charged with 22 counts of possession of child pornography, and other charges related to his unlawful sexual relationship with the minor. Investigators uncovered he groomed the minors by sending them gifts—including a cell phone so their communication could remain more private.  Ashley Moody, Attorney General, remarked about the predation perpetrated, “This case is disturbing, not only because it involves child pornography, but also because a popular online game was used to communicate with the victim.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grooming is defined as “a process by which a child predator gains the trust of a victim by building a relationship with the child and then breaking down his or her defenses.” Once a predator has earned their trust, they begin exploitation. Minors who are groomed in the gaming community are particularly vulnerable because the predator may literally be on their team. Cooperative play between players fosters a healthy, “there’s no ‘I’ in TEAM,” mentality, but predators use this relationship to manipulate the minor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of a predator’s greatest weapons when grooming a minor online is pop culture. The predator—perhaps unlike the minor’s parents—shows their target they’re “hip and cool”, and are able to converse at their level about something they enjoy. This causes the minor to lower their guard, and the predator begins their manipulation game, culminating in the exploitation of said  minor. Online gaming is becoming so ubiquitous predators have developed a way to sense when a minor’s gaming is suddenly being supervised. The moment a minor’s behavior changes—they stop responding to messages, or do so uncharacteristically—the predator can pick up on that and cease all communication before they’re caught. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, even if a parent is supervising the communication between their minor child and other players online, it doesn’t mean they cannot be groomed. In the grooming process, between the introduction and the beginning of the exploitation, predators often suggest moving their communications to a third-party app, like What’sApp or Snapchat. These are apps where communications disappear with ease, and a parent performing their due-diligence in supervising their child’s internet safety may not notice, or even know how to access.</span><a href="https://www.teensafe.com/blog/predators-groom-children-gaming-online/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TeenSafe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says it’s critical parents learn to recognize the signs of grooming in their minor child. </span></p>
<p><b>Signs of Grooming<img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1997 alignright" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Master.png" alt="predators and online gaming " width="635" height="955" /><br />
</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your child wants to spend more time online or playing games on a console, but won’t tell you why. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your child does not want to discuss what he or she does online, or what websites he or she visits. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You notice your child is using inappropriate language he or she would not have heard within your home or at school. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you walk in a room, your child quickly changes the computer screen, mutes the volume on their gaming console, or turns it off all together. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortnite and other games with similar messaging platforms have been on law enforcement’s radar for the last few years as the instances of these cases continues to grow. In August of 2018, Titania Jordan, a digital safety expert, appeared on </span><a href="https://www.thedoctorstv.com/articles/how-to-keep-kids-safe-online-predators-while-playing-video-games"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Doctors</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide parents with helpful tips—not just for supervising their children’s gaming—but also for establishing boundaries that can nip grooming in the bud. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not allow minors to have computers, game consoles, or tablets in their room without supervision. Keeping these devices in common areas will increase visibility and deter predators from targeting them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instruct your child to never reveal any personal information about themselves to people they’ve met online, especially very specific information, such as where they live or where they go to school. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a culture of openness in your home where children feel comfortable coming to you if they feel uncomfortable about an interaction they’ve had online. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People of all ages play video games, but the vast majority of players are either minors or young adults, and parents often find themselves overwhelmed with the strange new world of online gaming. Titania Jordan reminded parents knowledge is power, recommending they verse themselves in the games their children play. This can only heighten your ability to detect when something is off. This means doing research online, and actively listening when your children describe normal gameplay behavior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an internet connection in your home may feel like you’re inviting predators into your home. And true, there’s no time to supervise every single activity your child does online. This is why it’s so important to nurture an open line of communication between parent and child. Not only will parents be able to sense when something is amiss in their child’s online interactions, but a strong bond between parent and child makes it less likely that an online predator will be able to isolate the child emotionally and manipulate them for the purposes of exploitation. </span></p>

They tell you they have your child and will kill them unless you pay a ransom – they direct you not to call police or you will never see your child again.</p>
<p><strong>What would you do?</strong></p>
<p>You tell the person on the other end of the phone not to hang up. You don’t want to disconnect with the one person that can reunite you with your child. You plead for your child’s safe return. “Please don’t hurt her. I will do whatever you want,” you say. And, you would!</p>
<p>They demand you go to the bank and wire a ransom of several thousand dollars. Do you call the police? Do you pay the ransom and hope the thug will return your child to you safe?</p>
<p>A child going missing is every parent’s worst nightmare, and for those who do have a missing child &#8211; living with such ambiguity is said to be the most traumatic of human experiences.</p>
<p>Sounds like a situation that only happens in the movies, right? Or, something that only happens to the wealthiest people in society.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has declared virtual kidnapping a violent crime and issuing warnings to parents that scammers are targeting parents and demanding a ransom in exchange for the safe return of children they kidnapped . . . well, virtually kidnapped. Police throughout the country are following suit, issuing warnings in their communities.</p>
<p>Police throughout the country are following suit, issuing warnings in their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1976" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kid-1024x572.png" alt="kid" width="1024" height="572" /><strong>What is a Virtual Kidnapping?</strong></p>
<p>A virtual kidnapping scam is an attempt to dupe victims into paying a quick ransom. The virtual aspect of the scam involves staging a scene on the phone to convince a person that a loved one has been kidnapped, following with a demand for ransom.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, “The success of any type of virtual kidnapping scheme depends on speed and fear. Criminals know they only have a short time to exact a ransom before victims unravel the scam or authorities become involved.”</p>
<p>Typically, the scam is executed by calling a victim claiming they have kidnapped a loved one, then demand a ransom in exchange for the loved one’s safe return.</p>
<p>Valerie Sobel is one such person who did receive a call from a person who said, “We have your daughter’s finger. Pay up or you’ll get the rest of her body in a body bag.”</p>
<p>Petrified, Sobel rushed to a money transfer location to pay the ransom, wiring $4,000 to the person who claimed to have kidnapped her daughter.</p>
<p>Valerie made many frantic phone calls to her daughter’s cell phone and after many hours had passed, her daughter Simone called her back totally confused but safe.</p>
<p>Basically, scammers call random numbers hoping to find a person who they can convince, while other times these scammers research Facebook and other social media platforms for names and numbers. If a scammer calls 100 people, chances are at least one will instantly pay.</p>
<p>Another way it may go down is a scammer calls you and you hear a child crying, “Mom, please help me.” Panic immediately sets in. You think it is your child. Then a man’s voice comes on the phone and calls you by your first name. This legitimizes the caller and you immediately ask them to just tell you what they want. What mother would not empty her bank account in exchange for her child’s safety.</p>
<p>If you don’t think you could become a victim, please read on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1977" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ched-1024x724.png" alt="ched" width="1024" height="724" /><strong>Virtually Kidnapped Daughter</strong></p>
<p>According to the Washington Post, Wendy Mueller lives in historic Leesburg, Va., and never thought she would become a victim of a virtual kidnapping scam.</p>
<p>One afternoon, while standing at her kitchen sink, she received a call from a number she did not recognize but answered.</p>
<p>She heard screaming and it sounded like her 23-year old daughter’s voice begging for help.</p>
<p>Then a man’s voice tells her, “we have your daughter.”</p>
<p>The caller told Mueller to put her phone on speaker, get her purse and phone charger and get into the car.</p>
<p>The man asked, “How much cash can you get right now?”</p>
<p>$10,000,” Mueller replied.</p>
<p>The man told her not to contact anyone for help or they would kill her daughter.</p>
<p>Mueller’s daughter attends college hundreds of miles away and she had no way of knowing her daughter was safe.</p>
<p>“They told me they were actually targeting someone else, someone they would be able to get a lot of money for. But they said my daughter intervened when they tried to grab him. And that sounded exactly like something she would do,” Mueller said.</p>
<p>“I was terrified,” Mueller continued. “They told me they wouldn’t hesitate to kill her.”</p>
<p>The caller had told Mueller he had hacked her phone and knew every move she was making. For hours, he told her to go to small stores and offices across Northern Virginia, where she wired the max amount of usually $1,900 each time to names and addresses in Mexico that the caller had given Mueller.</p>
<p>Mueller cross-crossed the state following his directions and making payments, until nightfall came.</p>
<p>Mueller had kept asking to speak to her daughter.</p>
<p>“They kept promising me: ‘As soon as you send the last one, you will talk to her,’” Mueller said.</p>
<p>The caller told Mueller he was a professional and part of a group of kidnappers – a huge organization – who do this all the time and kill.</p>
<p>The man told Mueller they had placed a set of headphones on her daughter so she could hear everything, so her daughter would know if her mother did anything to cause her death.</p>
<p>Mueller thought of stopping passersby but didn’t want to chance the kidnapper knowing.</p>
<p>“It was torture,” Mueller said.</p>
<p>As it turned out, her daughter was in class, safe and sound. Mueller had been scammed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No one is immune</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of families throughout the country have become targets of these malicious scammers.</p>
<p>According to FBI kidnapping expert, Agent Eric Arbuthnot, several organizations use these scams regularly to make money.</p>
<p>“Thousands of dollars in ransom,” said Arbuthnot. “And you’re talking about a criminal organization that is capable of doing more than one kidnapping at a time.”</p>
<p>According to Arbuthnot many of the cases have been happening on the West coast and along the border involving criminal organizations from Mexico, some claiming to be members of the cartel.</p>
<p>The FBI has seen recent increases in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas and increasing on the east coast.</p>
<p>Monroe Police Department in Connecticut said by using social media, scammers can identify a victim, look up relatives, and reference names of family members and friends to make the call appear legitimate.</p>
<p>FBI Supervisory Agent Christopher Johnson said his office in St. Louis, Missouri, deals with these types of crimes. “Scammers will often mention specific facts about the parent or victim, likely from information they were able to obtain online.”</p>
<p>Authorities say about one in five kidnapping cases are successful resulting in the criminal getting their ransom and not getting caught. While extortion has been around for decades, virtual ransom kidnapping calls are increasing around the country.</p>
<p>With this emerging scam, the FBI has launched a nationwide campaign to warn parents to fight back against “virtual kidnapping.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1978" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/guy-1024x573.png" alt="guy" width="1024" height="573" /><strong>If you receive a virtual kidnapping ransom call</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional kidnapping schemes, a “virtual kidnapper” has not actually kidnapped anyone. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation, if you receive a call from an individual demanding a ransom for the safe return of a kidnap victim, it is suggested you quickly evaluate the following to determine if you are receiving a legitimate ransom call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caller insists you stay on the phone.</li>
<li>Call does not come from your child’s cell phone.</li>
<li>Caller tries to stop you from contacting the kidnap victim.</li>
<li>Call includes demand for ransom to be paid via wire transfer.</li>
<li>Ransom amounts may decrease quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Knowing what to do</strong></p>
<p>Police say it is best to hang up the phone but:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you engage the caller, don’t call out your loved one’s name.</li>
<li>Deliberately try to slow the situation down and ask to speak to your child directly.</li>
<li>Ask “proof of life” questions like, “How do I know my loved one is okay?”</li>
<li>To gain confirmation if your child is an actual kidnapping victim, ask questions only your child would know such as the name of a pet.</li>
<li>Listen very closely to the voice of the person speaking, if possible record the call.</li>
<li>If possible, have someone else try to call your child’s cell phone, school, by text, social media, etc., to confirm their safety.</li>
<li>To buy time, repeat the caller’s request and tell them you are writing down the demand, or tell the caller you need time to make arrangements.</li>
<li>Don’t agree to pay a ransom, by wire or in person.</li>
<li>Don’t deliver money in person.</li>
<li>Immediately call your local FBI office and police.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), as of March 31, 2017, there were 86,618 active missing person cases in the FBI database, with 8, 792 entered as involuntary.</p>
<p>Experts agree that an actual kidnapping with a ransom demand is quite rare but all experts urge parents to be vigilant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1970" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/child-1024x526.png" alt="child safety" width="1024" height="526" />How easy would it be to kidnap a child in a crowded place? Maybe the park, walking home from school or even sleeping in their own bedroom. Over again, we see parents of missing children making pleas for the safe return of their children on the news. We see the Amber Alerts and Facebook posts and immediately picture our own children’s faces, thinking “What if it happened to me?” A common reaction to something so traumatic.</p>
<p>A young child becoming the victim of a predator is every parent’s worst nightmare, but the fact is, it is happening every day to parents throughout the country and our own fears do not wane just because our children are getting older.</p>
<p>I am a parent of four grown children and a mother who has worked in the field of missing persons for over 25 years. Every day I interacted with parents who were desperately searching for their missing child. Their pain unimaginable. Very quickly I realized the crime of abduction does not discriminate based upon a child’s age.</p>
<p>Commonly, we think of small children when we hear the word kidnapping and we think as our children age, they are safer, but the fact is, they can become even more vulnerable as they approach adulthood.</p>
<p>While teenagers are venturing out, without the protective eye of a parent, there is even more chance they can cross paths with a potential kidnapper. It is our responsibility as parents to guide our children throughout their lives and hopefully provide them with some tools that will keep them safe.</p>
<p>According to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), approximately 800,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States. That number accounts for nearly 2,000 per day.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimates a relatively small number, approximately 115 of those missing children are abducted by strangers and listed as an “involuntary” abduction in the national database of missing children. However, this number does not account for children (to include teens), who are listed in the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) in various categories such as “Endangered Missing,” “Runaways” or “Other.” Many of these disappearances are considered “long-term” with more than a year having passed with no resolution or explanation as to how or why the child disappeared. The fact is, we just don’t know, therefor accurate statistics impossible.</p>
<p>One thing we all can do as parents is prepare our children. Much of the following information and tools have proven to save lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Communicate with your children</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Predators do not look like the “Boogieman.” Strangers look like everyone else. Children need to understand that everyone is a stranger, even women and seniors. It is not about being unsociable, explaining this is about being cautious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Agree to a code word</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Strangers have no business asking a child for directions or a lost pet. Many times, a predator will try to coerce a child into coming with them voluntarily without causing a scene by telling them they were sent by their parents to pick the child up. Agree to a simple “code word” like “Giraffe” or “Cheetos” that your child can remember and tell them to only trust an adult who knows the code word.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Walking Away</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Children should be taught to trust their instincts and walk away if a stranger approaches them. Though not all people are dangerous, it is always more important to be safe than being polite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Don’t put your child’s name on personal items</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Children will tend to trust others who know their name. Never put your child’s name on personal items such as clothing or backpacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Just scream</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If approached, children should be taught to scream and run. Reassure your child the likelihood of being approached by a stranger is minimal but should it happen, to scream “This is not my dad” or “Fire” while running away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1971" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mpposter-1024x633.png" alt="missing child" width="1024" height="633" />The stakes are high when a child becomes the target of a predator. It really is a matter of life or death. According to the FBI, statistically when a child is abducted by a stranger, the likelihood of recovering them alive diminishes with each hour that passes.</p>
<p>When a predator has targeted its prey, survival depends upon fighting back. For example, if approached with a knife or gun and told to get in a car, statistically the child or teen have more of a chance surviving if they fight back at the initial crime scene. Survival rates drop when a child is transported to a second crime scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Communication</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As children get older and spend more time away from parents, it is important to communicate openly with them. They need to know the dangers and reality of abduction without feeling fear which can be paralyzing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Not alone</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Children should never answer the door when home alone or answer the phone and tell the caller their parent is not home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>No compromises</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Use the “Buddy System” and teens should always inform their parents where they are going and with who. No compromises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>No shortcuts</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Children should avoid shortcuts through empty parks, fields, and alleys. It is better to always remain in a well populated area to be safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Life-saving technology </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Use a GPS on their phone. There are free Apps such as Life 360. The App can be loaded on both the child’s phone and the parent’s phone and track location. Personally, my children are all grown with their own families now but my daughter and I both use Life 360 to keep tabs on each other. Though teens may demand their space, their safety trumps the right to privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, promote a home atmosphere that is open so kids can let you know what is going on in their lives. It is important to help them to have an understanding and confidence you want the best for them. Thomas Lauth has been in the private investigation industry for over 30 years, and in the cases of missing children, he stresses the importance of communication between parent and child, &#8220;We often get calls for missing children and teens. Once located and reunited with their families, we often educate parents or caregivers on tenets that would prevent this from occurring again. Regardless of circumstances, the most important thing is communication. Not only open and honest communication between parent and child, but communication safety concerning things like social media. In a world where young people are glued to their devices, it&#8217;s paramount that they remember to have awareness of their surroundings. Communicate, Educate, Communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Teaching children techniques to avoid an abduction</strong></p>
<p>The window of opportunity to save oneself from danger might be seconds and children need to feel confident enough to make a split-second decision. In addition to coercion, abductors use intimidation. There are some techniques you can practice at home to build their self-confidence should they ever be face to face with a kidnapper.</p>
<ol>
<li>Practice yelling “Stop, Stranger” or “Fire” to draw attention and yell as loud as they can.</li>
<li>Practice the Windmill technique which means rotating arms in a big circle so a potential attacker can’t get a good grip.</li>
<li>Practice the Velcro technique by having your child grab and hold onto something, not letting go. They should also learn to scream while doing this.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a child is abducted and somehow placed in a vehicle, they should know they need to take any opportunity they can to escape while trying to keep a cool head.</p>
<ol>
<li>Children should be taught not to be passive but proactive.</li>
<li>Try to open the passenger side door quickly or jump in the back seat and try to escape through the rear doors.</li>
<li>If placed in a trunk, they should be taught not to panic but to look for the “release” that opens the trunk upon pulling on it. Tear all the wires to the tail lights and brakes if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know this is a very serious and scary topic and just the thought of having to explain to an innocent child that some people are out to hurt them is incredibly uncomfortable, but when teaching others about fire safety, Benjamin Franklin said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” It applies throughout life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1946" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PI-nita.jpg" alt="blending in private investigator" width="762" height="288" />According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2010, there were over 34,7000 licensed private investigators operating throughout the United States. The Bureau projects by 2020, the figure will increase twenty percent—resulting in almost 42,000 PIs. Though they may be great in number, you may  never spot one, because private investigators have a unique set of skills allowing them to blend in with all walks of society. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the average person thinks of a private investigator, it often evokes a handful of stereotyped images. Sherlock Holmes is one of the most famous private investigators in the global lexicon—even if he is fictional. In the United States, the film <em>noire</em> genre gave average citizens a staple look for PIs; long, tan trench coats, matching fedora hats, toting cameras with obnoxiously long lenses. More contemporary private sleuths are often thought of as being clad in all black and wearing dark sunglasses.  Because these images have permeated American culture, a private investigator fitting any of these descriptions can instantly have their covers blown. With a surge in surveillance culture and the ubiquity of technology and social media, private investigators in the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century must modify their investigative methods to adapt to a world where everyone is watching. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1947 " src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/468482500-612x612.jpg" alt="blending in in a crowd" width="986" height="658" /></p>
<p><b>Close, But Not Too Close</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in a world where individuals often have their eyes glued to a screen, it is easier than ever for a private investigator to have their cover blown while in the field. Rise in the saturation of crime coverage in both local and national media has citizens paying attention to their surroundings more than ever, especially when walking to and from their vehicles, and when developing a home security system. Despite concerns about the proverbial “Big Brother,” invading human privacy, the U.S. began to appreciate surveillance technology as a nation after a CCTV camera captured the perpetrators behind the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22274770"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston Marathon bombing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the summer of 2013. Law enforcement investigating the tragedy were able to identify Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in a crowd of thousands, tracking every move they made until the fateful moment when they planted the two homemade pressure-cooker bombs killing three people and injuring hundreds more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the nation saw a rise in law enforcement agencies utilizing drones in their investigations, leading to a new wave of outrage and concern over the violation of privacy and spying. As of December 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/rise-in-us-police-use-of-drones-triggers-backlash-over-spying-and-other-abuses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 900 law enforcement agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were reported to use drones in their casework. This heightened awareness in the American population has forced private investigators to redefine their standards for proximity to a subject. Of course, a PI must be close enough to properly observe the subject, and despite their benefits, long camera lenses outside of large events inundated with press can just as likely be the aspect that blows a private investigator’s cover. Being too close to a subject can provoke them to confront the investigator and compromise the entire investigation. This obliterates future opportunities for surveillance and collection of evidence, as the subject will be on high-alert. </span></p>
<p><b>Do Your Homework </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to a stake-out or any form of field surveillance, private investigators must conduct extensive research about the area in order to move fluidly and avoid detection. Study of local businesses and restaurants can inform a private investigator what the public will be doing in the area, and increase their chances of successfully blending in with a crowd. In order to keep a low profile, PIs must place themselves in the mindset of a local. Places like coffee shops, restaurants, or shopping malls can be ideal places for surveillance, as there are built-in explanations for a person sitting or milling about without purpose for extended periods of time. In situations where this is not the case, it’s important for the investigator to have a method for making themselves appear occupied to cover their presence in an area. Luckily, a person staring at their phone for large blocks of time will raise no alarms with the subject or anyone else. Books, laptops, or accompaniment by an associate for “lunch” are also tried-and-true covers. Many private investigation periodicals </span><a href="https://www.pinow.com/articles/2462/how-to-not-be-spotted-a-private-investigator-s-guide-to-blending-in?signup_code=roundup&amp;mc_cid=c8034ad5f1&amp;mc_eid=ee24787a14"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducting as much online research as possible prior to surveillance in order to limit exposure. This means searching public databases, combing news articles, and scraping social media to arm oneself with as much information as possible.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1948" style="width: 1851px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1948" class="size-full wp-image-1948" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Joerg-Dsterwald-paints-model-allowing-her-to-blend-in-with-her-surroundings.jpg" alt="Blending in as a PI" width="1841" height="1227" /><p id="caption-attachment-1948" class="wp-caption-text">Blending in is the name of the game when you&#8217;re a private investigator.</p></div></p>
<p><b>Stealthy Sleuths </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, everyday citizens are more hypervigilant than ever. Subjects with a history in the criminal justice system or with law enforcement will be even more so. As such, the concept of tailing a subject is becoming less effective, resulting in the private investigator “getting made” by their target. Subjects will recognize the same face after multiple sightings, even if it is in a crowd, and strange vehicles parked in the same location for hours at a time are sure to draw suspicion. This is where thorough research with a private investigator’s client can become invaluable. Reconnaissance at the hands of a client can provide the investigator with information allowing them to be more inconspicuous when following a subject from location to location. For example, a spouse suspicious of infidelity can provide the private investigator with their spouse’s daily schedule—what time they wake up, their morning routine, addresses for their employment, frequent lunch locations, extra-curricular activities, the addresses of friends’ homes, the list goes on and on.</span></p>
<p><b>Competent Cover </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the most catlike of private investigators will have their covers blown from time to time. That’s why it’s imperative to have a bulletproof cover story. If they’ve done their research, private investigators can be ready with a plausible reason for being in the area, such as house-hunting, shopping, or just being plain lost and in need of direction. These quick explanations will cause a subject to lower their guard and reconsider their suspicion. Just as is the case with any deception, too many details pierce the veil. Being caught with surveillance equipment like cameras or microphones will also require explanation, but in a culture saturated with technology, this can also be easily explained. Camera drawing too much attention? Not if you’re a professional photographer on assignment. Microphone too conspicuous? It’s no longer a stretch to believe the average citizen is a fledgling podcaster or filmmaker recording </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/blog/post/what-18-common-sound-terms-actually-mean"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“foley” or “walla”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noise for their project. </span></p>
<p><b><br />
Gender Bender</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
<img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1949" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cover-ebook-2000px-longest-side-300x281.jpg" alt="female private investigator" width="300" height="281" />As is the case with many professions, media and culture have defined the role of private investigator as one for a man, which often </span><a href="http://swaay.com/women-reshaping-private-investigation-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaves women out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the conversation. However, it could be argued female private investigators have a much better chance of remaining undetected in surveillance. While social code continues to grow and develop, women are often socialized to diminish themselves—to listen, not speak. Follow instead of lead. Men are socialized to be forward and confident in the interest of being some kind of alpha, while women are known to be better at reading a room, picking up on behavioral cues that might inform their investigation, and their perceived gentility improves their chances of a subject or witness trusting and opening up to them. These aspects of our society are the same ones preventing citizens from suspending disbelief when a woman is accused of a violent crime. A woman would never do that. This allows a female private investigator to conduct field surveillance with more freedom. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has spiked over the last 25 years at astronomical proportions, and our population’s socialization has changed dramatically since the invention of social media. While this may have hampered private investigators in their work, the proper tools, flexible strategies, and an analytical mind can get the job done. Whatever a private investigator’s method for remaining inconspicuous in the field, there is no doubt that as society changes, so must their methodology. </span></p>

Seeing as how November 1<sup>st</sup> is the 305<sup>th</sup> day in the calendar year, it would appear that the spike in active shooter events in recent years will not slow down any time soon. While schools redefine their safety protocols and implement programs that prepare students for these events, employers throughout the United States are also beginning to understand the importance of preparing their workforce for an active shooter event.

The year of 2017 broke the record for the most mass-shooting deaths every recorded—<a href="http://time.com/5010973/sutherland-springs-texas-mass-shootings-history/">112 deaths</a>, well exceeding the amount in any other year in recorded history. In 2018, <a href="https://www.clomedia.com/2018/06/08/how-to-prepare-for-active-shooters-in-the-workplace/">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> published a report that showed another spike in workplace homicides. According to them, there were 83 workplace homicides in 2015, a number that skyrocketed to 500 for the year of 2018 alone. A terrifying 79% of those cases were the result of an active shooter. As a result, the desire for employee active shooter training has never been higher, with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/02/11/466416680/at-many-workplaces-training-for-a-new-threat-active-shooters">NPR</a> reporting that as of 2016, 75-80% of employers are seeking qualified active shooter training to protect their workforce.

<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/active-shooter-pocket-card-508.pdf">The Department of Homeland Security</a> has a myriad of resources on their website for dealing with active shooters. One of them is a pocket-card that outlines the characteristics of an active shooter event, “Victims are selected at random. The event is unpredictable and evolves quickly. Law enforcement is usually required to end an active shooter situation.” &nbsp;Active shooters may fire at random, using no discernible criteria for their victims, but that arbitration should not be misunderstood. Perpetrators are deliberate, focused, and simultaneously detached from their task, creating a fatal perfect storm.

The Department of Homeland Security also have their own guidelines to how private citizens should react during an active shooter event: <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/active-shooter-pocket-card-508.pdf">Run—hide—fight</a>.

<strong>Run</strong>

At the onset of an active shooter event, individuals should immediately identify an escape route, most likely a fire exit. While keeping their hands visible, they should leave their belongings behind and run to safety as quick as possible, assisting others if needed.

<strong>Hide</strong>

Once they’ve reached safety (or if escape is impossible) the Department of Homeland Security recommends hiding immediately in a location out of the shooter’s line of sight. Individuals should block the door or manner of entry into their hiding spot and silence their cell phones and pagers. Sit very quietly and wait for first-responders to find you.

<strong>Fight</strong>

The Department of Homeland Security lists this option as an absolute last resort in the event of an active shooter in the workplace. Your life should be in immediate danger, and you should be well-positioned to act with physical aggression and incapacitate the shooter.

Many third-party security companies also endorse the methods of Homeland Security, but there are others that take a different approach. Laurence Barton, a workplace violence expert, recommends employers seek training programs that promote a culture of safety and preparedness—not fear. In lieu of careful research regarding active shooter training, many employers opt for the simple, cost-effective route by showing employees the prolific training video produced by the city of Houston, which features graphic depictions of employees being shot. “When some companies have created these videos that show blood and guts—that’s not in any way the kind of learning that stays with people. In fact, it repulses them…employees get scared,” Barton says, “I just don’t believe scaring people is the way to teach them. It just promotes anxiety.” Aric Mutchnick, the president of a risk management firm called <a href="http://experiorgroupinc.com/">the Experior Group</a>, agrees with Barton, “Cops or military guys like to have it very realistic because they think the more real it is, the more they can find out. That is true if you’re a tactical team, but you can’t apply tactical training to a civilian population.” Mutchnick points out that the equal distribution of choice laid down by the Department of Homeland Security—run, hide, or fight—is not only dangerous, but unrealistic, “It should be 90 percent run, 8 percent hide <em>until you can run</em>, and then as for fight, really? Are you kidding? I don’t know how you would even train on that.” Companies like Experior Group also recommend that a base knowledge of firearms should also be part of the training, not so employees can operate firearms, but so their knowledge can inform their escape. Civilians who are ignorant of basic firearm operations can easily be paralyzed by fear because they are uncertain of a weapons range or magazine size. This gives an active shooter ample opportunity to change their position and reload without fear of retaliation.

Frozen with fear—it’s something we can all relate to. After all, many working people today are not acclimated to the viable, potential threat of an active shooter in the workplace. Aggressive, hyper-realistic training can compound the anxiety triggered by the increased probability of being involved in an active shooter event. That’s why Barton and other like-minded professionals epitomize on a feeling of safety, with straightforward and honest training that will leave any employee feeling prepared. “The chief learning officer has a huge opportunity to lead a discussion about workplace safety. [Employees] are yearning to be informed about how the world is changing and how threats get processed at work…You want to have a subject matter expert who works with law enforcement and can speak the language of all employees.”

One thing that employers often overlook when considering active shooter training programs is a company that curtails the training to their individual brick and mortar location. As part of what they call “red ball drills,” Experior Group will evaluate the property to identify the specific issues that might present during an active shooter event. “The problems of a commercial building are not the problems of a hospital or a school,” Mutchnick says. “Run, hide, fight is s giant blanket they throw over the problem as a response, but it doesn’t deal with any site-specific issues.” All training dispensed by Experior Group is tailor-made for the culture and physical context of any business. When these issues have been identified, the instructor can direct employees the best manner of exit, should they have that option.

The last thing to consider when choosing an active shooter training program is the credibility behind the operations. Some of the most prolific risk management and security companies are headed by former members of law enforcement or the military. This experience with weapons and chaos not only validates the content for many employers, but also leaves employees empowered with credible knowledge. However, former navy seals and swat team leaders are not the only option when it comes to the instructor. Lauren Perry, the vice president of operations for Trident Shield, often addresses training groups. Her specific style and feminine touch opens the dialogue in any room, allowing individuals who might not respond to an aggressive, alpha males to remain engaged in the training, retaining the information that might one day save their lives.

Many employers often grapple with the cost of active shooter training for their employees. With many training programs averaging in the realm of thousands of dollars, employers often question whether or not active shooter training is even necessary. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 says, “Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe and healthful workplace that is free from serious recognized hazards.” The rise of active shooter events in the United States is most certainly recognized, with every event further inflaming the political world and conversations surrounding gun control. Given the statistics we’ve seen here, it appears as though it’s not a matter of if an active shooter even will occur, but <em>when</em>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1865" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/surveillance-cloud.png" alt="Surveillance Capitalism" width="1024" height="768" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first decades of the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, we have witnessed advances in technology unprecedented in human history. It was once costly and cumbersome to rely on technology to work for you. The reality today is astonishingly different. To view this article, you likely performed a Google search (or whatever your search engine of choice) and clicked through several links to get here. Advances in technology have made it possible for the search engine to collect the data you spread through the internet and use data to determine what kind of advertising you’ll see in the side banners of the websites you visit. For many in America, our phones and our cameras are the same device. Clunky security systems are a thing of the past, and spy cameras can be made as small as a button. This new reality has a name: surveillance capitalism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time in the United States where changing your identity was as simple as grabbing what you can carry, hopping a train or hitchhiking to a new location, and introducing yourself to others under a different name. Now, in the world of surveillance capitalism, almost every piece of data you put out in the world, either online or on an official form, will likely be entered into a database where you can be tracked by anyone with the proper clearance. At </span><a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauth Investigations International</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we use databases like these every day to perform skip traces, asset searches, and background checks. And then there’s the omnipresent threat of “Big Brother,” a moniker often attributed today to the government agencies, law enforcement, and other surveillance platforms who are constantly watching us on what can only be imagined as an IMAX display of viewing screens. Not to mention the entities that might be surveying us and our information in a manner not exactly above reproach, such as Google, Facebook, and every demonym of foreign hackers who see America’s obsession with its surveillance culture as its Achilles heel. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="alignnone" style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
<img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1867 alignleft" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bali-couple-call.png" alt="bali couple call" width="438" height="572" />It’s not all doom and gloom, of course. Humans in America and abroad have reaped the top-tier benefits of surveillance capitalism, such as using the “Find My iPhone” to locate someone who has been reported missing. In the recent high-profile case of a missing young woman from Brooklyn, Iowa, <a href="http://www.lauthmissingpersons.com/mollie-tibbetts-the-case-heard-round-the-world/">Mollie Tibbetts</a>, law enforcement were able to use data collected by Mollie’s Fitbit to piece together her last hours. This information would eventually lead investigators to the man who is now charged with her first-degree murder. Just this past week, an American couple </span><a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/09/06/14/24/scooter-bali-accident-rescue-facebook-stacey-eno-mikey-lythcott"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was saved in Bali</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a scooter accident left them both without a way to call local authorities for help. Mikey Lythcott, 36, was able to turn on the roaming data on his cell phone, and with a single bar of service, managed to pen a desperate call for help to his Facebook friends. The United States Consulate in Bali was contacted, and help was sent to the couple’s location. Knowing how well technology can work for us makes it that much more frustrating when we feel it has violated our privacy, such as the aforementioned data-mining that helps target you for specific advertisements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to impacting the way Americans live their lives, surveillance capitalism has already become a constipator for many well-established areas of the economy, such as journalism, transportation, and—in a fascinating irony—private investigations. While surveillance capitalism has certainly had a significant impact on American culture, there are many who have a misunderstanding of its omniscient power. In a recent article titled, “<a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/a-private-investigator-on-living-in-a-surveillance-culture/">A Private Investigator on Living in a Surveillance Culture</a>,” a private investigator named Judith Coburn, shared an anecdote where a client completely underestimated the available technology: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two lawyers working on a death-penalty appeal once came to see me about working on their case. There had been a murder at a gas station in Oakland 10 years earlier. Police reports from the time indicated that there was a notorious “trap house” where crack addicts were squatting across from the gas station. The lawyers wanted me to find and interview some of those addicts to discover whether they’d seen anything that night. It would be a quick job, they assured me. (Translation: they would pay me chump change.) I could just find them on the Internet. I thought they were kidding. Crack addicts aren’t exactly known for their Internet presence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrations like these are rampant in investigation firms across the country, but the advancements in technology do not prevent the use of tried-and-true analog methods, such as old-fashioned tailing surveillance, or telephone ruses without the use of any fancy phone surveillance tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of the </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0267364913000654?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“right to be forgotten”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was forged in the European Union, with individuals voicing their concerns about their inability to “determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmatize"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stigmatized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past.&#8221; Given the surveillance tech available to citizens, both private and public, it sounds like an unattainable status for anyone who uses social media, the internet, or walks by a security camera on their way to work every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, 2018, NPR published an article titled, “</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/28/589411543/google-received-650-000-right-to-be-forgotten-requests-since-2014"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Has Received 650,000 &#8216;Right To Be Forgotten&#8217; Requests Since 2014</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” detailing the mountain of requests fielded by the multi-national technology company to remove certain URLs from their search results on the condition the content is “inadequate, irrelevant or excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing.&#8221; The article goes on to say this means it is up to the discretion of a private company to determine what is in the best interests of the people who use their services, which is a tall-order in a capitalist society. Whether the policy proposed in the EU will ever be universally enforced—both in Europe and around the world—education regarding this newfound culture in which we find ourselves is paramount to protecting yourself and your loved ones from the evils of surveillance capitalism. </span></p>
