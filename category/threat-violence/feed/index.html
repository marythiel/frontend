<p>Employee <strong>intellectual property</strong> (IP) theft has grown to be a major issue in a society going more and more technologically advanced. The dangers to private data have increased as more businesses choose digital collaboration and remote work. Employee misbehavior involving sensitive firm data—that is, insider threats—may cause significant financial and reputation harm. This article looks at sensible ways businesses may protect their intellectual property, stop internal threats, and react fast when needed. By means of practical illustrations and Lauth Investigations&#8217; services, companies can better grasp how to safeguard their most valuable assets.</p>



<p><strong>The Rise of Insider Threats</strong></p>



<p>Though they are nothing new, the frequency of insider threats has risen as the workplace has changed. According to a Ponemon Institute analysis as of 2023 insiders account for around <a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/isaca-now-blog/2024/why-so-many-organizations-underestimate-insider-threats#:~:text=Approximately%2060%20percent%20of%20data,policies%20or%20opening%20new%20vulnerabilities.">60% of all data breaches</a>. This alarming figure shows the extent of the risk businesses. Employee access to private company data increases the likelihood of misuse—intentional or inadvertent. Particularly remote work has grown the digital footprint and given additional chances for internal data leaks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Rising Concern in Remote Work</strong></h3>



<p>Companies have less control over the physical security of their workspaces if workers operate from home or another off-site venue. While remote work solutions include cloud storage, shared document files, and collaboration platforms boost employee comfort of work, they also enable simpler access, transfer, and occasionally inappropriate data access. In these situations, insider dangers are more elusive to find. Standard security protocols might not be enough. This change emphasizes the need for revised, aggressive plans to protect intellectual property.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Real-World Example: Tesla’s Insider Threat Case</strong></h3>



<p>Tesla made news in 2023 when a staff member allegedly stole confidential data on its Autopilot program. Allegatively trying to sell the company&#8217;s valuable data to a rival, the employee downloaded private files. Through its internal security monitoring systems, Tesla discovered the individual&#8217;s actions and set out an alert when massive data access and transfer without appropriate authorization occurred. This situation shows the rising danger of insider threats and the need of having robust digital monitoring measures in place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategy 1: Establish Strong Access Controls</strong></h2>



<p>Tight access limitations are among the best strategies to safeguard intellectual property. This means making sure intellectual property and sensitive data are only accessed by authorised staff.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limiting Access Based on Roles</strong></h3>



<p>Least privilege should be the guiding concept for design of access limitations. Employees should only be able to access the data they actually need to carry out their job obligations. A software engineer working on a particular module, for instance, shouldn&#8217;t have access to a product&#8217;s whole source code. Businesses can drastically lower the likelihood of internal data theft by cutting the number of persons having access to private information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication</strong></h3>



<p>By guaranteeing that staff members access critical data only after passing through several security gates, multi-factor authentication (MFA) offers still another layer of protection. MFA allows one to prevent unwanted access even in cases of compromised login credentials for an employee. Companies can demand, for instance, a second authentication method—a phone-based code or biometric verification.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regularly Reviewing Access Permissions</strong></h3>



<p>Access control cannot be fixed once-only. Regular audits help to guarantee that staff members still have access to the data they have been assigned. Review and alter access rights as responsibilities evolve or staff members go. Lauth Investigations provides services to audit internal security policies of a firm, therefore assisting to find any weaknesses in access restrictions and suggest fixes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategy 2: Educate Employees on IP Security</strong></h2>



<p>Stopping insider risks depends mostly on employee training. Lack of knowledge causes many breaches when staff members unintentionally reveal intellectual property.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conduct Regular Training and Awareness Programs</strong></h3>



<p>Businesses should set up continuous training courses to inform staff members on the dangers of intellectual property theft, phishing campaigns, and safe handling of private information. Employees should also be informed of the policies of the company on IP protection and the results of violating these policies. Frequent employee testing via fake scenarios or simulated phishing attempts can also support strong security practices.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Promote a Security-First Culture</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond instruction, businesses have to create a security-first culture whereby staff members personally commit themselves to protect private data. This entails pushing staff members to document possible weaknesses they come across or suspected behavior. Employees are more likely to follow security procedures and be alert when they realize that safeguarding intellectual property is a corporate top concern.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Example: The Microsoft Insider Theft Incident</strong></h3>



<p>Microsoft had a security hack in 2023 in which an employee—who had received training on safeguarding private data—was accused of copying proprietary software code to sell it to a third party. The staff ignored the security systems even though they were in existence. This situation emphasizes the need of combining an informed workforce with effective security technologies. Although Microsoft found the problem fast thanks to training, more strict use of security policies may have completely avoided the intrusion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategy 3: Utilize Digital Monitoring and Analytics</strong></h2>



<p>Preventing insider threats mostly depends on proactive monitoring of employee behavior. Although this approach seems invasive, it is necessary to find and react to possible security breaches before they do major damage.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monitoring Digital Footprints</strong></h3>



<p>Particularly when employees access, download, or share private company data, companies should use tools tracking staff members&#8217; digital behavior. This can cover tracking email exchanges, cloud storage use, file transfers, and even actual USB drives. These digital monitoring technologies help companies identify odd activity, including viewing vast amounts of data outside of an employee&#8217;s purview.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Setting Up Alerts for Suspicious Activity</strong></h3>



<p>Automated alarms can be configured to inform IT teams anytime dubious activity takes place. For instance, the technology can instantly set off an alarm for inquiry should an employee access private files or download vast volumes of data outside of business hours. This fast reaction helps to stop data theft or compromise before it is too late.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Example: The Google Employee Data Theft Case</strong></h3>



<p>A Google employee was discovered in 2023 to have been accessing private product data unrelated to their line of employment. Google was able to stop the staff member from distributing the data to outside parties by flagging the unusual access through the company&#8217;s digital monitoring systems. This example shows the need of making investments in digital monitoring instruments to guarantee data protection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strategy 4: Conduct Background Checks and Vet Employees</strong></h2>



<p>A key chance for businesses to stop internal risks is the employment process. Reducing the danger of IP theft can be achieved by first making sure staff members are reliable before allowing access to private information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Background Checks for New Hires</strong></h3>



<p>Before recruiting staff, especially for positions involving access to private data, extensive background checks are absolutely vital. This can cover verifying references, past employment histories, and criminal records. In high-risk situations, businesses could also wish to look closer at the prior behavior of an applicant.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vetting Contractors and Temporary Staff</strong></h3>



<p>Before being granted access to private information, even contractors and temporary personnel should be thoroughly screened. Many businesses ignore this phase since they believe that only full-time staff members represent a hazard. But, especially if they have access to corporate networks or private data, contractors could potentially have the chance to pilfer or use intellectual property.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lauth Investigations’ Role in Employee Vetting</strong></h3>



<p>Lauth Investigations offers services designed to assist businesses in screening possible employees or contractors and evaluating their dependability. Background checks, fraud investigations, and other ways of confirming the integrity of people with access to private business data constitute part of their offerings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Businesses in the digital environment of today must first give protecting intellectual property from insider threats top importance. Companies have to be proactive in protecting their most important assets as remote work and growing dependence on digital technologies call for. Strong access limits, staff education, digital monitoring, and extensive background checks help companies reduce IP theft risk. Real-world situations such as the Microsoft and Tesla ones show how crucial strong security systems are. Professional investigative services, such those provided by Lauth Investigations, assist businesses to increase their defenses and guarantee that their intellectual property stays safe from insider threats.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) started a new corporate whistleblower test program on August 1, 2024. The goal of the program is to make businesses more open and responsible. This program is meant to get people to report wrongdoing at work by giving them money if they do. People who give information can then lose a lot of money and be successfully prosecuted.</p>



<p>The Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section of the DOJ is in charge of the program, which will last for three years. If it works, the DOJ may make changes or add to it. The main goal of the program is to improve white-collar crime prosecution by filling in gaps in present whistleblower systems. Companies need to be aware of this new development and make sure that their investigations at work follow the new rules.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-corporate-whistleblower-program-works"><strong>How the Corporate </strong><strong>Whistleblower</strong><strong> Program Works?</strong></h2>



<p>The DOJ’s corporate whistleblower program provides whistleblowers with an opportunity to earn monetary rewards for information that leads to criminal or civil enforcement actions. The program covers cases where a whistleblower’s tip results in forfeitures exceeding $1,000,000. The potential awards are substantial, offering up to 30% of the first $100 million in penalties collected and 5% of additional penalties, up to $500 million.</p>



<p>This financial incentive could increase whistleblower complaints being made directly to the DOJ or through internal company channels. Companies receiving such complaints should act quickly. They have 120 days to self-report any issues brought up by internal whistleblowers to remain eligible for more favorable treatment, such as a potential declination of prosecution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lauth-investigations-international-ensuring-compliance-and-effective-investigations"><strong>Lauth Investigations International: </strong><strong>Ensuring</strong><strong> Compliance and Effective Investigations</strong></h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-companies-need-a-strong-whistleblower-program"><strong>Why</strong><strong> Companies Need a Strong Whistleblower Program?</strong></h2>



<p>The DOJ&#8217;s new corporate whistleblower program adds more pressure on companies to have a solid whistleblower policy in place. A well-structured program allows employees to report misconduct anonymously, providing a safe and non-retaliatory environment. To comply with DOJ guidance, organizations must focus on four key areas:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Effective Reporting Mechanisms: </strong>Employees should be able to report anonymously or confidentially without fear of retaliation.</li>



<li><strong>Properly Scoped Investigations: </strong>Investigations should be conducted by qualified professionals to ensure fairness and thoroughness.</li>



<li><strong>Investigation Response: </strong>Organizations must act swiftly after receiving complaints and take appropriate corrective measures.</li>



<li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Companies should allocate adequate resources for investigating complaints and tracking the outcomes to ensure no issues are overlooked.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enhancing-whistleblower-programs-with-lauth-investigations"><strong>Enhancing Whistleblower Programs with Lauth Investigations</strong></h2>



<p>To comply with the DOJ’s new whistleblower program, companies need to enhance their current whistleblower policies. This involves setting up reporting mechanisms, such as hotlines, and training employees on how to use them. By partnering with Lauth Investigations International, companies can ensure their whistleblower programs are compliant and effective.</p>



<p>Lauth Investigations helps companies develop whistleblower programs that include clear policies on whistleblower protection and ensure employees know how to report misconduct safely. They also assist in creating a company culture that encourages transparency and supports employees who come forward with important information.</p>



<p>The DOJ’s new corporate whistleblower pilot program marks a significant step in encouraging transparency and accountability within corporate America. As the government continues to provide financial rewards to whistleblowers, companies must be prepared to handle an increase in workplace investigations. Failure to address whistleblower complaints adequately could lead to legal challenges and damage to a company’s reputation.</p>



<p>By partnering with Lauth Investigations International, companies can ensure they comply with the new DOJ program, protect their employees, and uphold a culture of integrity.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Found yourself in a confrontation with a colleague in the workplace? How well did this incident settle with you, and what strategies did both parties use to solve the problem? These are the kinds of questions that immediately come to mind whenever workplace violence is mentioned. How best to approach such type of squabble in the place of work mitigates the loss of productive hours, and it is the responsibility of the human resource department to segment appropriate measures of abating disputes that would result in violence. As an HR director, understanding the psychology around workplace violence is not just a necessity but a mandate for safeguarding the workforce and cultivating a culture of safety. It is also a chance to appreciate that human beings are different; therefore, studying individual behavior would significantly help in dealing with the workforce, helping them where necessary. Join me as we discuss the intricacies of human behavior and prevention and intervention strategies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-landscape-of-workplace-violence">The Landscape of Workplace Violence</h2>



<p>Before we discuss the integrities of workplace violence, it is paramount to comprehend the situation of the matter and how it has been entrenched into the working environment. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)</a>, workplace violence affects a considerable number of workers in the United States. These abuses span across different spectrums, including physical abuse, verbal abuse and harassment, and homicides. In the same vein, the effect is shown to affect all demographics, raising the question of whether the human resources professional are trained and equipped to deal with such hurdles.</p>



<p>Statistic further paints a sobering picture- that <a href="https://centerstone.org/our-resources/health-wellness/workplace-violence/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%2017%25%20of%20workplace,what%20exactly%20causes%20this%20phenomenon.">17% of workplace deaths are as a result of violence</a>. Most of the reported cases are from the healthcare, social assistance sector, retail and accounting sectors. This is because the sectors above involve high interaction with individuals, exposing the workers to different characters. Notably, workplace violence permeates all industries, underscoring the need to have proper measures to deal with the menace. As a start, an organization can embrace threat assessment done by Lauth to save both lives and money.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-perpetrator">Understanding the Perpetrator</h2>



<p>At the center of workplace violence lies personal psychology and environmental triggers. As opposed to the popular belief, perpetrators of workplace violence cannot be easily identified as outcasts. They are people within the workplace who may have succumbed to individual and professional pressures. Consider a case of an employee who has faced setbacks in the place of work, combined with personal stress. While the employees might contain themselves and not show any sign of stress, the outburst can disrupt the tranquility of the working environment. This highlights the interrelated nature of workplace violence. It is a product of psychological distress that should be addressed before causing problems at the place of work. Factors such as financial challenges, untreated mental issues, job dissatisfaction, and substance abuse can cause the problem, converting an ordinary person into a threat.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-role-of-intelligence-investigation">The Role of Intelligence Investigation</h2>



<p>In organizations with eminent potential for violence, proactive measures are necessary. While it is true that human resource directors have less training in establishing the possibility of violence in their place of work, this cannot be left as it is. The changing dynamics of workplaces demand innovation and always staying ahead of threats. One of the approaches to avert violence is conducting an intelligence investigation, which is the arsenal of the HR director. This includes analyzing data from different sources, such as employees&#8217; behavior, and external assessment, which enable the identification of threats before escalating into violence.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/Law-Enforcement/Criminal_Intelligence_for_Analysts.pdf">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a> study established that the role of intelligence investigation is to gather information and understand its relationship with other variables. Also, the study noted that intelligence investigation entails piecing up information and coming up with practical applications in the workplace to avert the dangers associated with violence. With this in mind, the importance of intelligence investigation cannot be overstated. Lauth&#8217;s threat assessment team will provide you with the crucial context you need to protect your employees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fostering-a-culture-of-prevention">Fostering a Culture of Prevention</h2>



<p>The evolving nature of work must be addressed, and it is the HR director&#8217;s responsibility to cultivate a culture of prevention. How do we ensure that your workplace has the right culture of protection? It all starts with the most straightforward thing- communication. Supporting open communication motivates the employees to report any form of threat before it escalates into violence. A sustainable organization gives staff in the lowest rank the ability to report cases of threat without intimidation and guarantees them protection. Also, training employees on stress management and de-escalation strategies will ensure the safety of the workers. If you suspect your workers are suffering in silence, consider involving Lauth&#8217;s services, and we shall conduct a comprehensive background check to unearth what you don&#8217;t know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>As an HR director, ensure employees&#8217; safety extends beyond policies and standards. Understanding the behavior of your employees is the starting point for designing appropriate interventions. Also, unraveling workplace violence and leveraging intelligence investigation tools would aid in navigating the challenges of risk. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, &#8220;<em>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</em>.&#8221;&nbsp; Let us act on this wisdom and ensure that workplace violence ceases to become a statistic but something of the past.</p>

<p>Picture this: a workplace where employees feel respected, safe, and valued. Sounds good, right! Unfortunately, this is not always an ideal situation. The study by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revealed that workplace violence affects about 2 million people every year in the United States alone. These figures may be scary and mitigate your determination to conduct business. Fear not, as there are well-proven strategies that you can implement to safeguard your employees and organization. This article will discuss five effective methods to create a working environment where safety reigns supreme.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Comprehensive Prevention Policy</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine a castle without robust walls; it will be prone to attacks. Similarly, the organization and employees are at risk without a workable prevention policy in the workplace. Policies are internally created and customized to fit the nature of your business. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all policies, as different organizations engage in activities with varied levels of risk. Studies have shown that workplaces with clear violence policies report lower incidences. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine indicates that companies with violence policies experience 40% fewer cases than those without such guidelines.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The policy should define terms such as harassment, verbal abuse, and physical violence, which employees experience in the workplace. Notably, this policy document should also clearly indicate the reporting procedure, the disciplinary action to be taken, and the supportive mechanism for the victims. While some human resource directors might consider this a lot of work, it improves productivity. We, as Lauth, will conduct a proper violence assessment to give you insight into how well-prepared you are for incidences of violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Training and Creating Awareness among the Employees</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is self-fulfilling for a business owner to have a vigilant team that can detect threats. Employee training equips them with the necessary skills, such as interpersonal skills and conflict management, which makes them handle issues that could result in violence. The leading cause of violence within the workplace is a lack of understanding among the workforce, and appreciating diversity lessens violence. Investing in training saves time that could have been used to solve the conflict. For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) study showed that companies that invested in workplace violence training experienced a 70% reduction in workplace violence. Arm your team with knowledge!</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting Rigorous Risk Assessment</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps you cannot perceive the inherent risk that violence can bring to your business because it has never happened. Or better put, take into consideration an employee who gets injured while at work due to an incidence of violence, such as a physical altercation. Picture that regarding litigations related to work injury benefit claims, and I am sure you will appreciate the need to fortify your defense. A regular risk assessment identifies the vulnerabilities within your business. Through our experienced risk assessment investigator, we identify weak points in your system and provide a comprehensive report on improvements.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing Workplace Violence Prevention Teams</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Having a dedicated team of guardians for preventing workplace violence is the best thing you can gift your business this year. This team is instrumental in ensuring petty issues resulting from violence are handled out immediately before they escalate. A small problem, such as miscommunication, can snowball into physical or verbal abuse. It is prudent to establish a workplace violence prevention team consisting of experts from different departments, and their primary role would be to develop and implement violence prevention strategies.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Organizations with a workable workplace violence prevention team are good at establishing potential threats before they happen. This is supported by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), which indicated that 80% of the companies with violence prevention teams reported a decrease in workplace violence incidences. As a starting point, develop a violence prevention team and track the cases within the first year. The outcome will be appealing, and for you to achieve this, we suggest helping you with a corporate culture audit to serve as a mirror of exactly how prepared you are in regard to workplace violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting a Culture of Respect and Support</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Build solidarity among your employees. Being united is a compact pillar in mitigating violence in the workplace. Successful organizations foster a culture of respect and support, which essentially prevents violence in the workforce. This is because the employees feel valued, and they tend to propagate the value of respect to the advantage of the business. How do you cultivate a culture of support and respect? This happens through encouraging open communication and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination. These approaches create a sense of belonging, preventing conflict from escalating into violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is undeniably true that workplace violence impedes an organization&#8217;s growth and lowers productivity. As the workforce continues to become more diverse, the chances of conflicts, hence violence, would continue in the workplace. Therefore, it is wrong to sit and wait until an incident happens in order to act. This article has highlighted the different strategies you can adopt for your enterprise and stand out in averting the repercussions that tag along with violence. Lauth can help you with your violence assessment, risk assessment, and corporate audit to mitigate violence.</p>

<p>If yours is one of the countless businesses across the United States who wasn&#8217;t prepared to deal with workplace violence and got caught out, you&#8217;re sadly—but certainly—not alone. Statistics reveal that <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/workplace-violence-statistics/">as many as 90% of organizations</a> do not comply with federal OSHA reporting regulations and record-keeping in this area. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/workplace-violence-statistics/">55% of American employees</a> report being unaware or unsure of their employer&#8217;s emergency preparedness plans.</p>



<p>Sure, many businesses skate along relatively unscathed by this oversight. That is, until an unforeseen sequence of events brings it into shocking focus. If you have recently become aware of workplace violence or threatening behavior going unchecked on your watch, then this article is for you. As an employer, you can&#8217;t correct any past lack of readiness, but you can act responsibly today. Read on to discover the steps that you need to take next to prevent further damage, including human resource oversight, diligent investigations, corporate culture importance, and much more.</p>



<p><strong>The Potential Cost of Being Blasé About Workplace Violence</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve always imagined that worrying about things like workplace violence doesn&#8217;t need to be on your priority list, think again. Failing to take the issue seriously can result in a hefty price tag for American businesses. In fact, the <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/workplace-violence-statistics/">average out-of-court settlement</a> for workplace violence incidents runs at approximately $500,000, while a jury award settlement can painfully run into the millions. Yes, while you as an employer may not be the perpetrator, you can still be left with a business-sinking bill to settle.</p>



<p>Even on the lesser end of the spectrum, workplace violence on any scale can be a symptom of a toxic workplace culture that serves as a breeding ground for <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-theft/">employee theft</a> and even <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/white-collar-crime/">white-collar criminality</a>. With abusive workplace behavior comes decreased productivity, employee absence, and runaway turnover. Business reputations can suffer, and ultimately lawsuits can ensue.</p>



<p>As an employer, you may find yourself held responsible for the actions of others as a respondent superior who failed to step in, under the terms of premises liability, or through negligence in hiring or retention. In immediate strides of damage mitigation, you can not only respond to present reports of threats or violence at work decisively, but you can also take immediate steps to rectify your state of preparedness for the future.</p>



<p><strong>Damage Control for Threatening Behavior and Violence at Work</strong></p>



<p>As someone with corporate or human resource oversight, you have a duty to develop an effective violence prevention policy and program and communicate it effectively to employees. This will include conducting accurate violence and threat assessments, incorporating threat screening into your recruitment policies, providing effective training to your leadership team, and having clear procedural guidelines in place to deal with both dangerous situations and their initiators.</p>



<p>To give an example, <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/workplace-violence-statistics/">although 62% of companies</a> view an active shooter as a top threat, around 79% report feeling unprepared for an incident of this kind. Resolution can be found in an expert <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/threat-violence-assessment/">threat and violence assessment</a> from Lauth Investigations International.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another instance, a leader may have allowed a toxic workplace culture to fester, only to see bullying escalate into violence. A swift and efficient <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/corporate-culture-audit/">corporate culture audit</a> can quickly redress this imbalance, while <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/background-checks/">comprehensive background checks</a> can prevent the arrival of more bad actors in the future.<br>Do you need help with launching impartial workplace investigations following reports of threatening or violent behavior in the workplace? Would you like expert guidance on how to make your place of employment safe, secure, and robust against the threat of nefarious employees moving forwards? If so, the Lauth Investigations team is here and ready to assist. We support businesses across America every day in their quest for strong corporate culture and ultimate prosperity.

<p>The nation was rocked once again by the news of <a href="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/?s=mass+shooting">yet another mass shooting</a> in San Jose, California. The San Jose shooting is now being described by law enforcement officials as the actions of a disgruntled employee in an act of violence perpetrated against his coworkers. Samuel Cassidy, 57, entered his worksite, a rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority at 6:30 in the morning with a duffle bag full of semi-automatic firearms with high-capacity magazines. Cassidy shot and killed 9 people who left behind families and loved ones in the aftermath of another tragedy in what has become a devastating state of normalcy.</p>



<p>Because there were no surveillance cameras in the rail yard, investigators have relied on witness testimony to fill in the blanks. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told the media that the San Jose shooting had the earmarks of serious premeditation, “ It appears to us at this point that he said to one of the people there, ‘I’m not going to shoot you.’ And then he shot other people. So, I imagine there was some kind of though on who he wanted to shoot.”</p>



<p>Possible motives for the San Jose shooting have only begun to emerge in the days following the violence. Cecilia Nelms, Cassidy’s ex-wife, told the Associated Press that Cassidy had ideations of homicidal violence against his coworkers as far back as 2012, when she recalled him saying he wanted to kill people at work. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now.” Nelms went on to state that Cassidy frequently expressed frustration or anger regarding his treatment at work, complaining of “unfair assignments.” The investigation into the San Jose shooting is still ongoing as law enforcement continue to piece together the pieces that lead to this violence. All the while, the families of the nine victims are left reeling, demanding answers as to how this could have been prevented.</p>



<p>As instances of mass shootings in the workplace continue to grow as a trending form of violence, employers and business owners continue to seek solutions to prevent it. While bolstering a workplace or worksite’s physical security measures are certainly a great way to protect employees, it can only go so far, as seen in the case of the San Jose shooting. The Valley Transportation Authority’s railyard was outdoors, and there are limits to how many checkpoints can be monitored and secured. Though security measure provide peace of mind, they cannot mitigate the systemic problems that toxic work environments cause. No evidence has emerged that the Valley Transportation Authority was a toxic employer, but the same cannot be said of all employers that have experienced mass shootings in their workplace. Toxic corporate cultures can potentially warp an employee into the sort who would open fire on his coworkers, and that’s why employers are more interested than ever in improving that culture.</p>



<p>Regardless of the motive for his deplorable actions, nothing would justify the senseless taking of nine lives and losses felt by hundreds more. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/27/us/san-jose-shooting-victims/index.html">The victims</a> were Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-6.jpg" alt="Molson Coors shooting
" class="wp-image-2291"/></figure>



<p>Just after lunch last Wednesday, violence erupted in
Milwaukee, WI at the famous Molson Coors factory, when an employee walked in with
a loaded firearm and began shooting, leaving 5 victims and the shooter
deceased. The violence is another in a string of shootings in the workplace that
has corporate leadership wondering what their role is in limiting these acts of
violence.</p>



<p>The victims in the Milwaukee Molson Coors shooting were identified as Jesus Valle Jr., 33; Gennady Levshetz, 61; Trevor Wetselaar, 33; Dana Walk, 57; and Dale Hudson, 60. The shooter, electrician Anthony N. Ferrill, 51, is deceased as well. Those victims, Ferrill’s coworkers, are remembered by the dozens of friends and family they left behind, as well as a community rocked by violence. Molson Coors chief executive Gavin Hattersley said in a news conference, “They were husbands, they were fathers, and they were friends. They were a part of the fabric of our company and our community, and we will miss them terribly.” </p>



<p>While many acts of violence in the workplace are perpetrated
by former employees, Anthony Ferrill was a current employee of Molson Coors.
Ferrill worked in the building’s utilities department. While authorities have
not established a clear motive for the shooting, according to the<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/02/milwaukee-molson-coors-shooting-miller-brewery-anthony-ferrill/4928061002/">
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,</a> Ferrill had a history of dispute with his coworkers
that many have speculated finally came to a head in the events leading up to last
week’s shooting. The dispute may have had racial overtones, with Ferrill
accusing other employees of discriminating against him in the workplace. He had
suspicions that other employees were trespassing at his home, bugging his
electronic devices, and disturbing his property. With the exception of one man,
Ferrill had previous confrontations with all the victims, yet police have
declined to comment on how the shooting occurred. </p>



<p>When shocking incidents of violence like this occur in the workplace,
it’s not uncommon to hear from leadership in the organization that they are ‘shocked,’
or ‘astonished’ at the events that have taken place, or that the violence was
perpetrated by a member of their organization. The reality is that active
shooter events and other forms of violence in the workplace can usually be
anticipated and prevented if leadership is not asleep at the wheel.</p>



<p>Most workplace crises, from violence to theft, can be traced
back to faulty internal operations. That’s why so many corporations are seeking
to have their daily operations evaluated by independent investigators and risk
assessment firms. These investigators come into your business and begin examining
hiring processes, onboarding materials, employee engagement, and the turnover
rate in an attempt to identify the problems that cause frustration within the organization.
In the unfortunate example of Molsen Coors, there was obviously room for more
supervision with regards to intra-employee conflict. If the alleged
intra-employee conflict had been given more attention, it might not have ended
in violence. </p>



<p>Corporate Culture Audit investigators can provide leadership with the insight they need to improve their daily operations. Investigators can review hiring protocol, identifying risk factors and lack of oversight. They can review security systems, both in cyberspace, and at brick-and-mortar locations to identify weaknesses that would leave the company vulnerable to attack. These are measures that could have prevented the violence that broke out at Molson Coors, and they can protect your company, too. </p>

Seeing as how November 1<sup>st</sup> is the 305<sup>th</sup> day in the calendar year, it would appear that the spike in active shooter events in recent years will not slow down any time soon. While schools redefine their safety protocols and implement programs that prepare students for these events, employers throughout the United States are also beginning to understand the importance of preparing their workforce for an active shooter event.

The year of 2017 broke the record for the most mass-shooting deaths every recorded—<a href="http://time.com/5010973/sutherland-springs-texas-mass-shootings-history/">112 deaths</a>, well exceeding the amount in any other year in recorded history. In 2018, <a href="https://www.clomedia.com/2018/06/08/how-to-prepare-for-active-shooters-in-the-workplace/">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> published a report that showed another spike in workplace homicides. According to them, there were 83 workplace homicides in 2015, a number that skyrocketed to 500 for the year of 2018 alone. A terrifying 79% of those cases were the result of an active shooter. As a result, the desire for employee active shooter training has never been higher, with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/02/11/466416680/at-many-workplaces-training-for-a-new-threat-active-shooters">NPR</a> reporting that as of 2016, 75-80% of employers are seeking qualified active shooter training to protect their workforce.

<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/active-shooter-pocket-card-508.pdf">The Department of Homeland Security</a> has a myriad of resources on their website for dealing with active shooters. One of them is a pocket-card that outlines the characteristics of an active shooter event, “Victims are selected at random. The event is unpredictable and evolves quickly. Law enforcement is usually required to end an active shooter situation.” &nbsp;Active shooters may fire at random, using no discernible criteria for their victims, but that arbitration should not be misunderstood. Perpetrators are deliberate, focused, and simultaneously detached from their task, creating a fatal perfect storm.

<img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1926" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web1_shooter_graphic-111413.jpg" alt="active shooter" width="640" height="266">

The Department of Homeland Security also have their own guidelines to how private citizens should react during an active shooter event: <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/active-shooter-pocket-card-508.pdf">Run—hide—fight</a>.

<strong>Run</strong>

At the onset of an active shooter event, individuals should immediately identify an escape route, most likely a fire exit. While keeping their hands visible, they should leave their belongings behind and run to safety as quick as possible, assisting others if needed.

<strong>Hide</strong>

Once they’ve reached safety (or if escape is impossible) the Department of Homeland Security recommends hiding immediately in a location out of the shooter’s line of sight. Individuals should block the door or manner of entry into their hiding spot and silence their cell phones and pagers. Sit very quietly and wait for first-responders to find you.

<strong>Fight</strong>

The Department of Homeland Security lists this option as an absolute last resort in the event of an active shooter in the workplace. Your life should be in immediate danger, and you should be well-positioned to act with physical aggression and incapacitate the shooter.

Many third-party security companies also endorse the methods of Homeland Security, but there are others that take a different approach. Laurence Barton, a workplace violence expert, recommends employers seek training programs that promote a culture of safety and preparedness—not fear. In lieu of careful research regarding active shooter training, many employers opt for the simple, cost-effective route by showing employees the prolific training video produced by the city of Houston, which features graphic depictions of employees being shot. “When some companies have created these videos that show blood and guts—that’s not in any way the kind of learning that stays with people. In fact, it repulses them…employees get scared,” Barton says, “I just don’t believe scaring people is the way to teach them. It just promotes anxiety.” Aric Mutchnick, the president of a risk management firm called <a href="http://experiorgroupinc.com/">the Experior Group</a>, agrees with Barton, “Cops or military guys like to have it very realistic because they think the more real it is, the more they can find out. That is true if you’re a tactical team, but you can’t apply tactical training to a civilian population.” Mutchnick points out that the equal distribution of choice laid down by the Department of Homeland Security—run, hide, or fight—is not only dangerous, but unrealistic, “It should be 90 percent run, 8 percent hide <em>until you can run</em>, and then as for fight, really? Are you kidding? I don’t know how you would even train on that.” Companies like Experior Group also recommend that a base knowledge of firearms should also be part of the training, not so employees can operate firearms, but so their knowledge can inform their escape. Civilians who are ignorant of basic firearm operations can easily be paralyzed by fear because they are uncertain of a weapons range or magazine size. This gives an active shooter ample opportunity to change their position and reload without fear of retaliation.

<img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-1928" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/activeshooter__12181450313950.jpg" alt="active shooter" width="1121" height="748">

Frozen with fear—it’s something we can all relate to. After all, many working people today are not acclimated to the viable, potential threat of an active shooter in the workplace. Aggressive, hyper-realistic training can compound the anxiety triggered by the increased probability of being involved in an active shooter event. That’s why Barton and other like-minded professionals epitomize on a feeling of safety, with straightforward and honest training that will leave any employee feeling prepared. “The chief learning officer has a huge opportunity to lead a discussion about workplace safety. [Employees] are yearning to be informed about how the world is changing and how threats get processed at work…You want to have a subject matter expert who works with law enforcement and can speak the language of all employees.”

One thing that employers often overlook when considering active shooter training programs is a company that curtails the training to their individual brick and mortar location. As part of what they call “red ball drills,” Experior Group will evaluate the property to identify the specific issues that might present during an active shooter event. “The problems of a commercial building are not the problems of a hospital or a school,” Mutchnick says. “Run, hide, fight is s giant blanket they throw over the problem as a response, but it doesn’t deal with any site-specific issues.” All training dispensed by Experior Group is tailor-made for the culture and physical context of any business. When these issues have been identified, the instructor can direct employees the best manner of exit, should they have that option.

<img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1929" src="https://lauthinveststg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/activeshooter__12101450298290.jpg" alt="active shooter" width="1484" height="1113">

The last thing to consider when choosing an active shooter training program is the credibility behind the operations. Some of the most prolific risk management and security companies are headed by former members of law enforcement or the military. This experience with weapons and chaos not only validates the content for many employers, but also leaves employees empowered with credible knowledge. However, former navy seals and swat team leaders are not the only option when it comes to the instructor. Lauren Perry, the vice president of operations for Trident Shield, often addresses training groups. Her specific style and feminine touch opens the dialogue in any room, allowing individuals who might not respond to an aggressive, alpha males to remain engaged in the training, retaining the information that might one day save their lives.

Many employers often grapple with the cost of active shooter training for their employees. With many training programs averaging in the realm of thousands of dollars, employers often question whether or not active shooter training is even necessary. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 says, “Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe and healthful workplace that is free from serious recognized hazards.” The rise of active shooter events in the United States is most certainly recognized, with every event further inflaming the political world and conversations surrounding gun control. Given the statistics we’ve seen here, it appears as though it’s not a matter of if an active shooter even will occur, but <em>when</em>.
