Read below about the methodology of our fact-finding and our standards for protecting your privacy.<\/p>\n<p>In private investigations, confidentiality is the name of the game. Our investigators are trained to move unseen in order to get the intelligence our clients need. Our mission is to carry out each investigation with due-diligence and discretion. We pride our team of private investigators on always maintaining strict ethical and professional standards when it comes to our clients\u2019 personal information. Our team is comprised of former military and law enforcement personnel with diverse training in both overt and covert investigations.<\/p>\n<p>Your privacy is important to us. We will not sell, trade, or give your personal information to any other entity. We do not disclose identifying information, including your email address. We only collect personal information relevant to the case. This Privacy Policy describes the client, the individual contracting LII for private investigation services, and how the information they offer is applied, stored, and retained.<\/p>\n<h2>Our Intake and Investigation<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to personal information our clients enter on the website, our private investigators will need to collect and catalogue personal information about our clients and the facts of their case at the onset of the interview. The purpose of this intake is to build a strong foundation for a swift and efficient investigation\u2014to uncover leads and develop a comprehensive strategy for the investigation. There are usually three types of personal client information:<\/p>\n<p>Information you provide: LII private investigators may collect and store personal client information entered into our website and provided to us by that client.

We exercise the same level of caution and discretion regarding all information gathered during an investigation and exercise due-diligence in making sure your information is protected.<\/p>\n<p>This fact-finding is crucial to laying a solid foundation of any case. We use our clients\u2019 personal information to achieve the goals specifically outlined by our clients. We do not share this information with third parties unless specifically instructed by the client or compelled by law.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We use the information provided to us by our clients to set up their casefile, verify their identity, and forward important updates on case progression. We also use information provided to us by our clients to fulfill any legal obligations that might arise as the result of any case solutions. We only process this information out of our clients\u2019 legitimate interests objectively and with good faith.<\/p>\n<p>We safeguard our clients\u2019 information by placing all available barriers between their information and the outside world, such as physical, digital, and human checkpoints to keep external threats out of reach.
