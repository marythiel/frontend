In this regard, you&#8217;ll want to be confident that any potential new recruit doesn&#8217;t have anything untoward lurking in their history. This makes uncovering whether they have committed personal crimes in the past a valuable, if not urgent, endeavor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many American businesses rely on their in-house HR team or recruitment firms to perform employee background checks. However, turning to skilled corporate investigators for this task can allow a far greater level of illumination, ensuring that any potential employee criminal record doesn&#8217;t remain under the radar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, a licensed corporate investigations firm can draw from many of the same databases used by law enforcement to build a clear picture of your job applicant or employee&#8217;s background, including not only their employment record but also any history of misdemeanors or felonies. Read on as we explore the advantages for employers when in-depth background checks are conducted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lifting the Lid With Comprehensive Employee Background Checks<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are countless reasons why employers should be concerned about the caliber of their employee background checks and the potential for historical personal crimes. For example, a hidden history of harassment, violence, theft, or discrimination may spell disaster for an otherwise stable and productive team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research suggests that <a href=\"https:\/\/standout-cv.com\/usa\/study-fake-job-references-resume-lies\">more than half of job applicants lie<\/a> on their resumes, and while some untruths may be relatively innocent, others could be absolute deal breakers. Proactively framing this statistic further is the fact that, as an employer, you are far from powerless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain types of dishonesty on a resume or job application can be considered fraud and, in the case of employees who have been hired based on false information, your business may be entitled to financial compensation. This makes comprehensive employee background checks a solid investment from multiple perspectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Corporate Investigators Can Safeguard Your Employees and Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From background checks to cases of corporate fraud, any investigation conducted within or to better protect the workplace is subject to a range of legislation and regulations. A seasoned corporate investigations firm will be able to guide you through these processes, ensuring that every &#8216;t&#8217; is crossed and &#8216;i&#8217; dotted when it comes to following the letter of the law.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our expert investigators will not only ensure that no stone remains unturned when it comes to gathering essential information about your prospective or current employees, but also thoroughly document every aspect of their process and findings, providing a firm foundation of support for any necessary follow-up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As professionals working within the corporate sphere, they will also maintain absolute discretion and confidence, protecting both internal and public perception of your brand at every turn.
