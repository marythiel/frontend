Even more so when children are involved. Figuring out custodial agreements is challenging and presents opportunities for disagreement that can span years. It\u2019s important that parents understand all of the resources available to them and how private investigators can be valuable assets in the fight to protect their children and secure custody.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Is your child coming home with signs of abuse?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">If you suspect your child is being abused, you need to begin documenting all of the evidence immediately. Bruises or marks, no matter how small or faint, must be photographed as soon as they are noticed. Photographic evidence is some of the strongest evidence you can produce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> It can be difficult to prove child abuse has taken place. Depending on the age of the child they may not be able to articulate exactly what happened. If the abuse was traumatic enough it could cause confusion when the child tries to explain what occured. The importance of adequately documenting potential abuse cannot be overstated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators have the equipment and insight to properly record suspected instances of abuse. Dealing with the court system is a private investigator\u2019s forte and they understand what the courts need to see and how it must be presented to prompt the courts to take action. When it comes to your child\u2019s safety, you cannot afford to delay seeking help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>I\u2019m concerned my ex is using drugs around our children.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">Across America a heroin epidemic is breaking out. Drug abuse is impacting people of all social and economic backgrounds. Recently a picture circulated news and social media of two adults passed out from a heroin overdose in their SUV while a four-year-old boy sat helplessly in the back seat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1149\" src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/parent-overdose-2-275x300.jpg\" alt=\"parent-overdose-2\" width=\"275\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> The female in the passenger seat is the boy\u2019s grandmother. She lost consciousness after shooting-up while her boyfriend drove. Upon being stopped by police for driving erratically, the boyfriend passed out too. The grandmother had only had custody of the boy for 5 weeks when this occurred.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> No one knew the grandmother\u2019s heroin abuse was so bad or she never would\u2019ve been granted custody in the first place. But this raises the question of how anyone could have known her addiction was this in strong? What red flags were missed that could\u2019ve kept this boy out of danger? Was this the first time the couple used drugs with the child present?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators are trained to pay attention to and take note of people&#8217;s abnormal behavior. Surveillance by a P.I. may have led to the discovery of the grandmother\u2019s drug abuse before the child was put in this potentially fatal scenario.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Thankfully the police were able to intervene and get the boy to safety. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>My ex isn&#8217;t spending their visitation time with our kids. What can I do?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> When the courts determine visitation time they do so expecting the parents to spend that time with their child. This isn\u2019t always the case though. Sometimes the parent will take the child for visitation time, but drop them off with a family member or baby sitter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> One parent passing their child off to someone else during visitation time not only deprives the child of time quality time, but it prevents the other parent from seeing their child as well. Depending on your state and custodial agreement, it\u2019s possible it\u2019s a violation of the law as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> The Right of First Refusal stipulates that when one parent plans to have a third party babysit their child during visitation time, they must first give the other parent a chance to say they will or won\u2019t watch the child instead. Private Investigators can provide records and documentation that demonstrates when visitation isn\u2019t being properly utilized to make sure the parents who want time with their child are getting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>I\u2019m worried about the new people my ex is bringing around our kids.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">One of the scarier parts of a divorce is knowing sooner or later your child is going to be introduced to new people you won\u2019t get the chance to know beforehand. No one wants their child around strangers, but it\u2019s an inevitable reality of separate parenting. It\u2019s possible the new people in your ex\u2019s life are wonderful, but why take any chances?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators can help alleviate these concerns. Investigators routinely perform background checks that can help you to better know who\u2019s around your child. Concerned about where your children are being taken when they\u2019re not with you? Surveillance can keep you informed about your children\u2019s condition and whereabouts when you can\u2019t be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Divorce is difficult.
