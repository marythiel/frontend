Losing the right to see your kids and spend time with them as you see fit isn\u2019t something anyone should face alone. Custody battles can be long, intimidating, and costly. You need every resource at your disposal to make sure you have the upper hand at every stop. Here are five ways private investigators can make sure you\u2019re not alone in the fight of your life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>1. Did you really know your ex?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">How well do you know your ex? When you got married you certainly believed you knew her inside and out, but you also didn\u2019t believe you&#8217;d end up divorced. Splitting up will change how you view one another. You\u2019ll start seeing flaws you never noticed before and having questions you thought you knew the answer too. You thought you knew her before you got married, but did you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> When did you first meet your ex? Have you known her since grade school or did you meet later in life? Are you certain this was her first marriage? Does she have a criminal history she kept hidden from you? Where has she worked and why did she change jobs? Private investigators can answer all of these questions and more by running extensive background checks and personally verifying the information for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>2. Who\u2019s coming and going?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">When you and your ex shared a home, you consulted each other before inviting people over. Together you decided who you did and didn\u2019t want inside your house. Now that you\u2019re apart, those determinations will be made separately, which might be cause for concern.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> It\u2019s one thing for your ex to bring people over when the kids aren\u2019t there, but what about when they are? Who\u2019s coming and going from the house and what are they doing? Maybe the increase in visitors is nothing. Maybe someone selling drugs from the house. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> In an ideal world you\u2019d ask your ex what\u2019s going on and get a straight answer, but that\u2019s likely not the case. Divorce can create tension and difficulty in communication. One way to avoid a big fight that won\u2019t get you the answers you want is to hire a private investigator. An investigator can surveil the home and determine who is stopping by and why. P.I.s will get you vital information while avoiding the drama of asking your ex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>3. Are my kids safe and clean?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">Children need a comfortable and clean environment. It\u2019s vital to their development that they have a space they can relax and feel safe in. Who took care of the house when you and your ex were still together? Have your kids made comments about their mom not keeping the house tidy like she should?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> It should be easy to find out about the condition of your ex\u2019s place, but maybe she won&#8217;t let you in out of embarrassment or scorn. If she\u2019s having a rough time dealing with the divorce it\u2019s possible she\u2019s depressed and not taking care of things like your children deserve. Private investigators can determine the condition of her home and help you ensure your kids are safe and comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>4. Where is your ex taking you children and are they safe?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">Worried about where your ex takes your children during her visitation time? At least when she stays home you know they\u2019re somewhere safe and controlled. They\u2019re in a familiar place and near a phone in case of an emergency. What happens when she packs the kids into the car and goes somewhere else though?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Depending on the age of your children they might need booster seats when they ride in the car. Are they to small to safely ride in the front seat? Is your ex properly placing them in safety restraints? Is she making sure they put their seat belts on every time they travel? Where is she taking your kids? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> People deal with stress differently. Some people take up knitting or learn to play a musical instrument. Others find themselves seeking the comfort of a bottle or narcotic. Are you sure your children aren\u2019t being driven around to liquor stores and bad neighborhood&#8217;s where your ex picks up her supplies? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators can answer all of these question with mobile surveillance. Investigators can track your ex to make sure your children aren\u2019t being placed in dangerous positions. Not only can P.I.s let you know where your children are being taken and how, but they can document instances of child endangerment for evidence\u00a0in court.<\/span><b> <\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>5. Who are these people?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">Splitting up with your ex means going in different directions and starting new lives. Building a new life requires developing new social circles. When you were married you knew you were coming home to each other and your kids every evening. Now that you\u2019re apart, other people will begin filling that void.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Can you trust your ex to keep you informed about the strangers she\u2019s bringing around your children? Maybe she genuinely trusts these people, but how good has her judgement been in the past? She might be a little too trusting for your comfort. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators can give you peace of mind by figuring out who she\u2019s introducing to your children. Running background checks and surveillance will give you a clear picture of who\u2019s interacting with your children and whether you should be concerned or not. Be certain that your kids are safe and know for sure if they\u2019re not<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fighting for custody of your children is the most important battle you\u2019ll ever wage.
