According to their website, the nonprofit \u201cadvances the common good in communities across the world. Our focus is on education, income and health\u2014the building blocks for a good quality of life.\u201d However noble their mission statement, United Way has been in the news recently as former employees have come forward with reports of a hostile work environment, prompting an internal investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United Way investigation began when former employers decided to take a stand against a toxic corporate culture. The allegations of a toxic, hostile work environment came in the form of a letter that was signed by an anonymous group of former United Way of Summit and Media, citing pervasive problems such as racism, sexual harassment, and nepotism. While the word \u201canonymous\u201d raises eyebrows in conjunction with whistle-blowing, it bears pointing out that these former employees claim they will be subject to retaliation. The letter was sent to United Way board members on July 31, prompting board chairman Mark Krohn to announce the onset of an internal investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harassment and bullying are just one of the allegations made by the former employees who signed this letter, and this has led to one United Way board member already resigning. One of the first dominoes to fall in the United Way investigation was former board member Elizabeth Bartz, who was in charge of running government affairs in Akron, Ohio. Leadership from the United Way of Summit and Media began investigating Bartz after there were allegations that she had verbally abused employees on social media. Bartz used Facebook Messenger to send a private message to another former employee, calling them a \u201ctoothless piranha\u201d and accusing them of attempting \u201cto ruin UW\u201d with their allegations of bullying in harassment\u2014ironically by engaging in bullying and harassment. This led to Bartz\u2019s resignation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bartz\u2019s reaction to the anonymous letter might actually validate these anonymous claims by former United Way employees. However, according to an article by the <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.beaconjournal.com\/news\/20200828\/group-of-former-current-united-way-employees-disheartened-by-report\">Beacon Journal<\/a><\/em>, these anonymous former employees are feeling ignored after an investigator reported that the allegations in the letter \u201cwere mostly unsubstantiated.\u201d A former employee who claimed to speak for the group told the<em> Beacon Journal<\/em>, \u201cIt\u2019s clear it\u2019s not an objective report\u2026We can\u2019t keep talking if we\u2019re not going to be valued and our experiences are going to be diminished. It\u2019s pretty disheartening when someone says they were sexually harassed and they are told it was \u2018he said\/she said.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frustration and feeling of defeat expressed by these anonymous employees are the effects of poor corporate culture in motion. Like a piece of antique furniture with termites, poor corporate culture can rot a company from within. Looking at the list of grievances these former employees are citing\u2014racism, sexual harassment, nepotism\u2014these are all enormous and complex problems that are not created in a vacuum. The corporate culture of the workplace must be an environment where these issues are able to thrive in order to develop a pattern of behavior. When employees make claims about these types of internal issues, it is in the best interest of the corporation to submit to an independent corporate culture audit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your corporation or organization is experiencing repeated instances of internal difficulty, it might be time for a corporate culture audit. A corporate culture audit is a program that examines the internal policies of a corporation or organization, how those policies are enforced, how they effect the employees, and how those employees relate to each other as a result. If the corporate culture in a company is good, that positivity is baked into the internal operations, employees feel valued by their organization, and therefore will remain engaged and invested in maintaining productivity. Pervasive, repeated internal problems may not stem from a single factor, but the entire corporate culture of the workplace. Think of a corporate culture audit like a medical check-up for a business or organization. Lauth\u2019s investigators evaluate the culture from leadership down, identifying the major factors in disruption, and advise leadership on how to improve their business from within.
