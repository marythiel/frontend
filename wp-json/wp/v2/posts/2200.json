Risk assessment firms specialize in identifying the weak points in a business from their workforce background to their brick and mortar security. However, if leadership is going to invest in improving their corporate culture, it\u2019s important that they pick a program that offers comprehensive services. While risk assessment firms might employ highly capable auditors capable of identifying security oversight or performing background checks, every business is different, and it\u2019s important that the program selected fit every business true-to-form.

Private investigators have an eye for detail, diligent drive,\nand a meticulous ability to evaluate and make recommendations based on what\nthey\u2019ve observed. These are the types of professionals you want when it comes\nto assessing the culture of your business or organization. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Independent risk assessment firms are just as excellent in\nidentifying the risk factors that put a business or organization at risk, such\nas vulnerabilities in their securities, faulty hiring processes, and at-risk\nemployees based on their history\u2014but what about the human element within a\ncorporate culture audit? Corporate culture audits are so much more than\ncomparing documents and surveying brick-and-mortar locations. It\u2019s also about\nunderstanding how current employees function in a workplace ecosystem. Private\ninvestigators, with a wealth of experience in evaluating human behavior and\nemotions, can be the boots-on-the-ground investigators who can speak with\ncurrent employees and collect data on their impressions of the current work\nenvironment and how the culture can be improved. Some of the questions private\ninvestigators may address include, but are not limited to: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Is\neveryone in the company invested in the same things?<\/li><li>What\nare the valued differences between your corporation and the competition?<\/li><li>What\nare the key measures of success within your company?<\/li><li>What\nis the functionality of the leadership in place versus the leadership required\nfor success?<\/li><li>What\nare the environmental factors that are contributing to the decline in culture?<\/li><li>What\nis the history of your company\u2019s culture from its foundation?<\/li><li>What\nare the subcultures that have formed in your organization and what is their\nrole within the company?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By answering these questions and calculating the human responses, private investigators can provide executive leadership with recommendations based on more than what exists on paper; for example, the last item on that list regarding the identification of subcultures. Private investigators do not only look at the behavior of individual employees, but also how those employees relate to each other. In workspaces where there are employees of 10 or more, it is hyper-common for subcultures (or groups) to form. This happens when individual employees gravitate towards one another as a result of their shared interests, goals, or gripes. Their comradery can either contribute to the <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/08\/the-cycle-of-corporate-culture\/\">cycle of corporate culture<\/a>, or undermine it. When a subculture forms because the employees all have similar degrees of dissatisfaction with their job (regardless of the reason), their validation of one another in solidarity can be a cancer within the organization. This is why it\u2019s imperative to hire corporate culture auditors who have a high level of understanding of human behavior\u2014they can provide a comprehensive picture of how their current employees are contributing to the cycle of corporate culture. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While\nprivate investigators may not be able to dismantle subcultures, they can change\nthe conversation within those subcultures.

This is one of the ways that we improve the cycle\nof corporate culture.
