During the Korean War, he served as a Company Commander, gaining empathy for both those who served for him and the people that he was working to protect.<\/p>\n<p>Over 30 years later, decorated commander and President&#8217;s Volunteer Action Award winner V.R. &#8220;Swede&#8221; Roskam and his wife came into Sandoval&#8217;s life in the most unexpected of ways. The Roskam&#8217;s were taking a vacation to Vietnam when they heard of a local bazaar which sold dog tags from fallen soldiers.<\/p>\n<p>Roskam&#8217;s wife, Martha, said, &#8220;V.R. told me, &#8216;That&#8217;s not right that they&#8217;re being sold. They belong to the families or the veterans who lost them. Get back there and buy them all.&#8217; &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A few moments later, and $20 lighter, Mrs. Roskam was given all of the tags the woman had to sell. As soon as the Roskam&#8217;s were back in their home state of Illinois, they were trying figure out how to find the rightful owners of the priceless mementos of lives lost overseas.<\/p>\n<p>With the help a private investigator, the family created a plan to ensure that the families were able to receive the long-awaited last token of their fallen men. The created a website, authenticated 33 out of the 37 dog tags, and began a network of information that would eventually result in the return of all of them.<\/p>\n<p>One of these dog tags &#8211; battered and bent &#8211; belonged to a man named Alfred Moreno JR. Through the tireless efforts of the private investigation team, the Illinois National Guard, and the National Archives&#8217; National Personnel Records Center, they were able to return the battered tags to a shocked and grateful Ann Sandoval. As Roskam placed the tag of Alfred Moreno JR in her hands, she burst into tears.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s home now,&#8221; she said, clasping the tag around her neck. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine someone being this kind to come all this way to bring me back this tag.

Still, when the draft began just a few years later, Moreno was one of the first to sign up. Despite Sandoval&#8217;s pleading that he not go to war, the 20-year-old was determined to serve. A land mine explosion cut his life short just a few months after arriving in Vietnam.<\/p>\n<p>The dog tags in her hands brought all of these bittersweet memories back to Sandoval, and the Roskams and the private investigation team were moved to tears.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_756\" style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.knox.edu\/news\/news-archive\/journey-to-return-dog-tags-ends?mode=print\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-756\" class=\"wp-image-756 lazyload\" alt=\"V.R. &quot;Swede&quot; Roskam and Martha Roskam\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Roskam2.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"198\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 250px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 250\/198;\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-756\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo via Knox.edu<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The Roskam&#8217;s son Peter, an Illinois Senator shared the group sentiment. &#8220;We knew this was going to be a Herculean task, but we had to get these back to people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Each one of these tags represents a story of a life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>V.R. &#8220;Swede&#8221; Roskam passed peacefully on March 13, 2015.
