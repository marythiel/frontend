Nor does he carry a gun. He&#8217;s never been shot at or had a knife or gun pulled on him.<\/p>\n<p>But he&#8217;s helped reunite parents with their runaway children, exposed people lying on workers&#8217; compensation cases and even spent four months on a company bowling team to build trust so he could root out workplace crime.<\/p>\n<p>The 48-year-old Elgin man and private investigator shared anecdotes and dispelled some myths about the work of detectives on Sunday afternoon while promoting his book, &#8220;Private Investigation: A Guide for the Beginner,&#8221; at Books At Sunset in Elgin.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not always like Agatha Christie where you have high friends in high places to help you along the way,&#8221; said Herdrich.<\/p>\n<p>He described his book as a general reader about how to get started pursuing a career in the field. The book also contains real-life stories about some of the cases during his 19-year career.<\/p>\n<p>He specializes in fraud investigations, criminal defense and locations, such as finding runaways or the birth parents of clients who were adopted.<\/p>\n<p>Herdrich, who has taught continuing education classes on private investigation at Elgin Community College for five years and Harper College in Palatine for three years, said he doesn&#8217;t like to do surveillance work because it&#8217;s time consuming and he can only focus on one case.<\/p>\n<p>He likes &#8220;the puzzle&#8221; behind location-type cases.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Communication skills are so important in this industry because you don&#8217;t know who you&#8217;re going to have to talk to to get information,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A good private detective is the first person to arrive, the last person to leave and the person nobody remembers that much about.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Herdrich said private investigators in Illinois must be licensed by the state, but there is no formal college program to earn a degree to become a detective.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of investigators have military or law enforcement backgrounds, but it&#8217;s not essential. Future private eyes must work several years for a licensed investigator and later pass a state test.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no real education. I&#8217;d like to see that changed,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Herdrich is slated to speak again at 2 p.m. April 25 at Books at Sunset, 1100 South St. For more information, call (847) 888-1868.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailyherald.com\/story\/?id=369236\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Edward Herdrich can&#8217;t bug your ex&#8217;s phone.
