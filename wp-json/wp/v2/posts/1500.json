The majority of P.I.s are honest and work diligently to satisfy their customers and close cases quickly, but like any other industry, there are bad apples in the bunch. Here are some ways private investigators get bad reputations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Dishonest pricing<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Sometimes people come to private investigators in a tight situation and needing help quickly. Individuals can feel pressure to get assistance as fast as possible, especially if it\u2019s a scenario involving their children. Some P.I.s may sense the stress a potential client is facing and exploit it for their own gain. Bad investigators might overcharge these clients who are in a rush to get the work done or aren\u2019t familiar with the industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> In order to drum up business P.I.\u2019s may give clients below market rates to secure their business. Investigators may offer lower prices for the first job only to raise prices for follow-up work. It\u2019s a classic bait-and-switch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> In both instances the best way to protect yourself from unfair pricing is to shop around and do your own research to compare prices. Don\u2019t accept the first estimate you hear. Request estimates from other private investigators and consult with individuals who have worked with P.I.s before you finalize a deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Creating false expectations<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">Whether it\u2019s a missing item, missing child, or background check on someone you don\u2019t know, you wouldn\u2019t be considering hiring a private investigator if it wasn\u2019t important. A mistake some P.I.s make is promising too much and creating false expectations in the minds of their clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">The odds of a successful investigation varies from case to case. Investigators need to be accurate and honest when assessing a client\u2019s request. Descent investigators will be upfront with clients about the chances of successfully fulfilling their needs. Private investigators you should avoid will promise results they know they\u2019re unlikely to deliver just to get a paycheck.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> It benefits both the client and investigator to understand the challenges they\u2019ll face. Adequately communicating the chances of solving a case prevents the client from unrealistic expectations and potentially heart breaking disappointment. It will also enable the client to better understand the steps and methods the investigator takes. Honesty and integrity are vital to a healthy client-investigator relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Failing to get results<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> No one wants to spend money on a service that doesn\u2019t get results, especially when it comes to the kind of sensitive matters one employs a private investigator for. It\u2019s frustrating to feel like you\u2019re throwing money down the drain and wasting time on the wrong resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Investigations are a difficult line of work, but a quality investigator consistently closes their cases. When you\u2019re looking for a P.I. to assist you, make sure you check online for reviews through services like Google, Yelp, and Angie\u2019s List. Investigative firms should be able to offer references or previous client testimony to help you know you\u2019re making the right choice. You wouldn\u2019t try a new restaurant without checking reviews so why treat your investigate needs any different?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Private investigators do a variety of work for individuals and businesses.
