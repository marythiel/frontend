If you work in construction and you&#8217;re shaking your head in disbelief, then consider this your wakeup call. Construction embezzlement happens every day in America, and safeguarding your business against the sly intentions of fraudsters and scam artists could save it from a derailing crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joy Wilde was the trusted bookkeeper of a Californian construction company. Her boss, Greg Weimann, had no idea that Wilde had been fraudulently siphoning funds out of his business for years. By the time he realized what was going on, she&#8217;s embezzled the staggering sum of $877,000 from the company. Last year, Wilde <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalconstructionreview.com\/construction-bookkeeper-sentenced-10-years-embezzl\/\">was sentenced<\/a> to 10 years in jail for her crimes. A satisfying justice, perhaps, but you can bet that recovering from such a devastating loss and the upheaval of a law suit, media coverage, may take the victim just as long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tough truth of this tale is that Joy Wilde serves as only one example of endemic corporate fraud\u2014criminality that carries a global annual price tag expected to rise to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.riskmanagementmonitor.com\/construction-fraud-costs-an-estimated-860-billion\/\">$1.5 trillion by 2025<\/a>. So, if white collar crime has nothing to do with the kind of collar on a neck that sits behind a desk, what exactly does the term mean? Simply put, white collar crime describes the actions of anyone in business who illegally takes money from their employer or anyone else they do business with. That means customers, clients, suppliers, or subcontractors can be the target, and crucially, so can you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Safeguard Your Company Against Construction Embezzlement<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Denoting an equally unfriendly term, embezzlement is when someone steals or misappropriates of funds placed in their trust or belonging to their employer. If you run a construction company, then you won&#8217;t have any difficulty envisioning the ample opportunity for embezzlement that this industry affords. Payment applications and invoices can be falsified, labor and material costs inflated, change orders manipulated, and the Schedule of Values used to conceal substituted savings and divert funds. When the dangers of bid fixing and collusion are added to this equation, construction companies find themselves in murky waters indeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This raises the obvious question: how can such companies protect themselves against the possible impacts of construction embezzlement and other forms of white collar crime? Well, safeguarding can be conducted in a number of different ways. Enlisting a corporate investigations firm to carry out <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/background-checks\/\">comprehensive background checks<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/corporate-culture-audit\/\">periodic corporate culture audits<\/a> can help you identify foxes in the hen house before they strike, so to speak.
