That being said, individuals who are looking for a bargain bin deal when hiring a private investigator find themselves highly dissatisfied with the end result. These are sophisticated investigations that require the best tools and the best expertise available in pursuit of the truth. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t ways to save money when hiring a private investigator. The answer lies in the pre-investigation phase before you\u2019ve officially contracted the private investigator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality fact finding is the basis of any quality investigation. Private investigators spend hours at the beginning of an investigation combing verified databases comparable to the ones used by law enforcement every day. Private investigators run names of all relevant subjects through these databases in order to build comprehensive background checks on the subjects in the case. These background reports have to be cross-referenced with multiple sources in order to perform due-diligence. Private investigators must take extra care to ensure that they have found the correct person in the database before This can become expensive, both in billable hours and in the cost of these verified reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clients who are looking to hire a private investigator can save money in these investigations by having a much information available as possible about all subjects involved at the onset of a case. When you hire a private investigator, private investigators will sit down with clients and begin taking an intake narrative. Here is the type of information you can have available to save the investigator some time and money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Name<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, you would know the full name of the subjects involved in the case. This is not always possible\u2014clients may only have a first name, or a nickname, which will lead to more fact finding on the part of the investigator. Having a person\u2019s full name (with the correct spelling) is one of the most relevant pieces of information you can have for an investigator at the onset of the investigation so it can be accurately cross-referenced during due-diligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Birthday<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A subject\u2019s birthday is the second biggest piece of information you can have when you hire a private investigator. A subject\u2019s birthday is cross-referenced with their name and other pieces of information to ensure private investigators have identified the correct report in their verified databases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Address History<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not necessary to know the exact address of a subject in order for the information to be valuable to the private investigator. Private investigators can use an approximate location to cross-reference other information on the subject and develop additional leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Work History<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing a subject\u2019s trade, the cities where they\u2019ve worked, or what companies they\u2019ve worked for can provide the same context as an address history. In a skip trace (subject location) investigation, a private investigator can use knowledge of the subject\u2019s trade in order to predict where they might go next to find work. A subject\u2019s occupation and how it affects their daily schedule can help a private investigator develop leads and identify possible surveillance locations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make and model of relevant vehicles<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A subject\u2019s vehicle, whether it is legally owned by them or otherwise is a useful piece of information for a private investigator to track a subject\u2019s movements. Depending on the location of the investigation, it may be legal for a private investigator to track a vehicle\u2019s movements with a GPS tracker. Using this information, private investigators can document a subject\u2019s movements for the investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Existing evidence<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to word of mouth information you might have regarding an investigation, the tangible evidence is also important. Any relevant documentation to the investigation, including financial records, court documents, social media screenshots, or voicemail and text records, can go a long way in saving a private investigator time during the onset of an investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, the best thing you can do when hiring a private investigator is gathering as much information as you possibly have for a private investigator at the onset of the case. It saves billable hours, resources, and frustration in any investigation. When you have your information ready, you\u2019ll need a private investigator who always sweats the details.
