What are signs of drug trafficking in the workplace? What can human resources do to stop drug dealing at work? These are questions every business owner and human resources department should be asking themselves before contacting a private investigator. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why is an employee meeting with people in the parking lot on break?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s common for drug deals to happen in cars. It makes for a quick and private way to do an exchange in plain sight. In the backseat of car, on break from work, is where Jade Violes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thestarpress.com\/story\/news\/crime\/2015\/12\/06\/three-held-pizza-restaurant-heroin-deal\/76888852\/\">sold<\/a> heroin while working at a Pizza Hut in Indiana. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2015, Violes was arrested for selling heroin after an undercover police officer purchased from her in the Pizza Hut parking lot. If an employee is meeting with people in cars during work hours it\u2019s not unreasonable to suspect they may be selling drugs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Why do employees keep meeting in the bathroom?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Do employees sell drugs in the bathroom at work? At the Senate mail room in Pennsylvania they <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pennlive.com\/politics\/index.ssf\/2016\/03\/senate_employees_fired_after_h.html\">did<\/a>. This past March two employees of the Pennsylvania Senate were charged with crimes related to the distribution of heroin. A third employee was also fired from their job in connection to the drug peddling. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Police were alerted to the crimes when an employee not involved in the inter-office drug trade found 20 packets of heroin in the bathroom. Corey Miller was charged with possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance after police found eight more packets of heroin in his wallet. Bathrooms can offer privacy to employees that some find too tempting to resist exploiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How can they afford all that stuff?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Does driving a fancy car mean someone is selling drugs? What about buying a new big screen TV and the latest smart phone? What if an employee is doing all of this and more? If this is the case then you may want to call an investigator.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Human resources departments know how much an employee earns from their job. If an employee is suddenly showing up in expensive clothes with fancy accessories and they haven\u2019t picked up a second job then something could be up. It\u2019s one thing to live outside your means, but there are limits to how much one can acquire on credit alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>We recently fired an employee for using drugs at work. Could there be more?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Was an employee recently fired for using drugs at work? Were they the only person using on the job? Were they buying drugs at work? These are questions every human resources department should be asking when an employee is caught using drugs on the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Some businesses believe the nature of their work precludes them from having drug dealers in their midst, but that\u2019s a mistake. It may be easy to write-off drug dealing from Pizza Hut, but it\u2019s tougher when someone like 53-year-old James Peter Kranyecz gets <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/lehigh-valley\/police-catch-man-selling-drugs-out-of-church\/99812505\">busted<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">selling marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine from the church he worked at. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>We caught an employee bringing drugs to work. Were they the only one?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Catch an employee with a small amount of drugs? Don\u2019t just assume it was for personal use. The packaging and quantity of drugs should be taken note of when considering what to do next. Did the employee bring drugs on-site for personal use or were they distributing to coworkers? Was the employee acting alone or with their coworkers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Earlier this year <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newsnet5.com\/news\/local-news\/cleveland-metro\/several-cleveland-mail-carriers-indicted-for-conspiracy-to-deliver-shipments-of-marijuana\">five<\/a>\u00a0United States Postal workers were arrested after conspiring to help distribute marijuana through the postal system. First, the postal workers gave their work schedules and routes to a drug dealer. Then the dealer timed when he mailed the drugs to make sure they ended up in the postal workers\u2019 hands. According to News 5 Cleveland, Michael Tobin of the US Attorney\u2019s Office said, \u201cThese are folks who had jobs, decent jobs as mail carriers, and they threw it all away for $200, $300, $400 of cash.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is an employee selling drugs from their job?
