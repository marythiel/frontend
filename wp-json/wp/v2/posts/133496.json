The inherent problem with any internal investigation is that any investigating agents who have a stake\u2014direct or otherwise\u2014in the insurance company cannot be completely objective.

One of\nthe greatest advantages of hiring a private investigator to vet insurance\nclaims is their valuable autonomy.
