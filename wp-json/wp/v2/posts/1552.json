The autopsy was conducted by a forensic pathologist on December 20, 2017, producing shocking results.<\/p>\n<p>The forensic pathologist and former Toronto homicide detective found markings on the victim\u2019s wrists consistent with being tied with a cord or plastic zip ties. However, when the bodies were found their wrists were not tied and no cords or rope were found at the scene.<\/p>\n<p>The forensic pathologist also conducted a toxicology report, concluding no signs of drug use.<\/p>\n<p>The Shermans were buried on December 21, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Greenspan has hired a private investigation team, including former homicide detectives, to ensure \u201cno stone is left unturned\u201d and work alongside police.<\/p>\n<p>The team has concluded the couple had been strangled to death with two men\u2019s leather belts around their necks and attached to the sturdy bar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Police Theory Debunked<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Sherman\u2019s real estate agent discovered the deceased couple in the basement of their $5.4 million home.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1556 lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Sherman-Home-For-Sale-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Sherman Home For Sale\" width=\"457\" height=\"343\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 457px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 457\/343;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In a Business Insider article, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/barry-sherman-canada-apotex-billionaire-justin-trudeau-political-lobbying-scandal-2017-12\">Mystery still shrouds the death of Barry Sherman, the Canadian billionaire found strangled in the basement of his $5.4 million mansion<\/a>,\u201d reports police have now marked the deaths as \u201csuspicious\u201d and a homicide \u2013 but not murder.<\/p>\n<p>A Toronto Sun cited \u201csources close to the case\u201d believe Honey may have been killed in another location of the house, then moved to the lower level of the home where their bodies were found.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas Lauth, CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\">Lauth Investigations International<\/a>, has 20 years of experience working alongside police agencies and prosecutors on unsolved murder cases. \u201cIn any homicide case, one must look at the circumstances from every viewpoint, even what may seem inconceivable,\u201d Lauth said. \u00a0\u201cIn addition to a thorough forensic examination of the crime scene, it becomes crucial to be able to analyze a crime scene for the unseen, and for anything that may create an \u201cat risk\u201d circumstance where someone is at higher risk to become a victim of crime be it their personal lives, business acquaintances, political activities, wealth, or all of the above.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Political Lobbying<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>August 6, 2015, Barry and Honey hosted a private $1,500 per-head fundraiser for the Liberal Party at his home.
