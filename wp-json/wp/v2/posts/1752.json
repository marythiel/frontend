However, the methods investigators used to identify the suspect have civilians debating whether or not the suspect\u2019s civil liberties were violated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investigators used DNA obtained from ancestry and genealogy platforms to locate a suspect matching the profile of the perpetrator. Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was arrested Tuesday morning, officially charged with 8 counts of Homicide committed in a decade span, across 3 California counties. They hope to eventually link DeAngelo to 12 murders and 45 rapes committed between 1976 and 1986. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DeAngelo worked as a police officer for 6 years during the original investigation\u2014a relevant detail, as investigators suspected the perpetrator had law enforcement knowledge. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of 1986, when the string of assaults and murders attributed to the Golden State Killer officially ended, the science behind DNA forensics in crime scene investigation was in its infancy. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.le.ac.uk\/departments\/emfpu\/to-be-deleted\/explained\/profiling-history\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first case<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in which DNA evidence secured a conviction in the UK in 1986 not only led investigators to the true perpetrator, but also cleared an innocent suspect whom had been previously implicated. In the last thirty years, the technology has become so ubiquitous DNA kits are available over-the-counter in drugstores all over the country. The technology has matured so immensely, the genetic profile of a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/nation\/article\/0,8599,1905706,00.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">single football<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be identified to prevent counterfeiting during the Super Bowl. And now, the newest trend in DNA technology may have helped Sacramento authorities identify the infamous Golden State Killer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1754 alignright lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/636560071434423354-GettyImages-912389900-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"636560071434423354-GettyImages-912389900\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 300px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 300\/225;\" \/>Websites like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ancestry.com\/?cj=1&amp;sid=66960X1516588X184a8771ac48e8ca42e203c282bf4047&amp;netid=cj&amp;o_xid=0007598037&amp;o_lid=0007598037&amp;o_sch=Affiliate+External\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ancestry.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.23andme.com\/howitworks\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">23andme.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have made it easier than ever for people around the world to find out more about their ancestry and genetic makeup.

Sacramento authorities have released information advising the DNA provided to these services for informative purposes was one of the chief investigative tools in identifying DeAngelo as a suspect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to lead investigator, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2018\/4\/27\/17290288\/golden-state-killer-joseph-james-deangelo-dna-profile-match\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul Holes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, GEDmatch was the database utilized leading them to DeAngelo. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gedmatch.com\/login1.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GEDmatch<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a research tool using a database of voluntarily supplied DNA samples for researchers and genealogists. &#8220;We were able to generate a DNA profile we uploaded into [a] &#8230; database of other similar types of profiles,&#8221; Holes told KGO. &#8220;And then from there, we get a match list of how much DNA these various other individuals share with the crime scene DNA. The more DNA they share, the more closely related they are.&#8221; After obtaining information from the GEDmatch database, they placed him under surveillance. They collected several samples of his discarded DNA, which they were able to match to a DNA profile compiled from samples collected at the plethora of crime scenes, subsequently leading to DeAngelo\u2019s arrest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Familial DNA searches are becoming more common in forensic science, and as such, more and more controversial. As was the case in identifying DeAngelo, investigators often submit a finite number of genetic markers into a database of genetic samples and the database will return a list of possible results. Results are then cross-referenced with other databases and records to thin the suspect pool. These practices are controversial because large percentages of the country\u2019s population share <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bridgesdna.com\/Understanding%20Genetic%20Distance%20for%2037.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the same genetic markers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, yielding ambiguous results for investigators. Many civilians feel as if the method leaves their civil liberties vulnerable, as though their genetic profiles might make them guilty by association. Currently, the only legislation preventing an individual from being discriminated against, based on their genetic information, is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/laws\/types\/genetic.cfm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1755 alignleft lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dna-forensic_2070437b-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"dna-forensic_2070437b\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 300px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 300\/188;\" \/>At a press conference on Wednesday, April 25<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, local law enforcement did not release specifics about how the DNA obtained from GEDmatch was used to locate DeAngelo. Instead, they focused on how a more comprehensive DNA databank in California could have led investigators to DeAngelo sooner. The existing legislations, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/oag.ca.gov\/bfs\/prop69\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proposition 69<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, was passed in 2004 and allows law enforcement to collect DNA and fingerprints at the earliest stages of criminal proceedings\u2014beginning when the suspect is arrested, as opposed to post-conviction collection. Despite controversy, the law was upheld earlier this month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations International Inc., whose firm specializes in unsolved homicides and missing persons, \u201cOur firm must always pivot to innovative ideas and think of ways to gather DNA from a potential suspect.\u201d Lauth further said, \u201cSearch warrants are required for human samples. However, if you can retrieve a sample from a discarded cigarette or beer can, it may prove positive. Sometimes though, obtaining positive-testing samples can be tricky. The labs could require numerous samples to finally get a positive and readable match.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On April 28<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in his first court appearance, Joseph James DeAngelo was formally <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-43928324\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arraigned<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on two of the eight counts of murder with which he is formally charged.
