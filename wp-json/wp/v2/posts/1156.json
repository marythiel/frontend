Juggling multiple cases for different clients is time consuming and can make giving adequate attention to every client\u2019s needs challenging. Here are everyday scenarios when private investigators can make an attorney\u2019s job easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Serving Subpoenas <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Cases can be won and lost based on which side has more witnesses show up to court. Subpoenas are a great way to compel people to be present for court, but what good is a subpoena if you can\u2019t find the person to serve it to? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Don\u2019t let a search for witnesses become a distraction from your work and a headache for your client. Tracking people down is a private investigator\u2019s bread and butter. Not only can P.I.s locate <i>known<\/i> witnesses, they can also canvas an area and do interviews to find more witnesses to strengthen your case. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Research and expertise<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Attorneys need to do ample research to be as prepared as possible every time they walk into a court room. They must know and understand as much about every case as possible. It\u2019s not always enough to know the facts of a case and you may need to bring in a third party to act as an expert witness. Investigators can help you find the right experts quickly so you don\u2019t waste your client\u2019s time and money on the wrong people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators spend a lot of time doing research. They can efficiently scour databases and identify applicable information to aid your client\u2019s case. Outsourcing research to P.I.s can reduce the costs incurred by your clients too. Attorney fees can stack up quickly and clients will appreciate saving money where they can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Preparing for Cross-Examination <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s1\">Testimony is one of the most powerful tools in any lawyer\u2019s tool box. Putting someone on the stand to give their personal account is powerful and can sway judges and jurors in a heartbeat. Knowing what to expect from the other sides witnesses, as well your own, can give you the edge during any hearing. Attorneys should never put someone on the stand without carefully considering the strengths and weaknesses of the individual and their testimony. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators can help evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your clients and identify potential areas of their testimony that the other side will try to exploit. Private investigators are experienced in court room scenarios and can even assist in mock examinations to better prepare your clients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Help Enforce Judgments <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Winning a case is every attorney\u2019s goal, but getting a judgement in your favor is only half the battle. What can you do if the losing side decides not to obey the judge\u2019s order? What if they attempt to misrepresent their assets and net worth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Hiring a private investigator to locate and identify assets before a judgement is passed down can help you know what you can get for your client. Knowing what the opposing side has ahead of time will prevent them from hiding assets and denying your client their just dues. It will also make it easier for the judge to understand what you\u2019re seeking and why.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Private investigators can be an attorney\u2019s best friend.
