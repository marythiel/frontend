It\u2019s not hard to understand why a corporation would want to minimize the impact of a corporate crisis. Corporate crises come in many forms, and all of them have undeniable effects on the workplace, corporate culture, and the bottom line. That\u2019s why employers must be vigilant of problems within their workplaces, address those problems with independent corporate investigations, and foster an environment where there is an open dialogue to address pervasive issues within the workplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignoring a corporate crisis will not ensure the problem will go away. The idea of \u201cletting it blow over,\u201d does not guarantee the problem will not occur again. Pervasive, repeated patterns of corporate crises are indicative of a deeper error in the company\u2019s operations. Only by addressing the root of these issues can a company hope to avoid these problems from repeating in the future. Many companies do have shareholders and other interests to protect, but ultimately, the issue must be addressed in order to avoid further losses. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial for employers to know when it\u2019s time to hire a private investigator for their corporate investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bribery<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons bribery may occur within a business. Perhaps an employee is offering cash to an inspector to buy their silence on certain violations on their worksite. The same could be said of an employee who bribes a government representative in exchange for the same discretion. If not exposed, not only can this cause infinite negative ripple effects within the corporation, but if caught, the parties responsible can incur costly penalties, and possible prosecution. In order to prevent these losses, both financial and in public relations, employers must trigger a corporate investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A break-in, or other theft from the workplace should not be treated as an isolated incident. It\u2019s imperative that a corporate investigation can be triggered so the void in security operations can be filled and prevent further losses. If the corporation\u2019s security system requires and update, or if perimeter fences need to be reinforced, those items must be addressed. Thieves will continue to slip through the cracks if they\u2019re not properly patched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>White Collar Crime<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>White collar crime specifically refers to when crimes like bribery and theft occur at an executive level, denoting the perpetrator\u2019s level of access and perceived credibility within the company. They are elevated crimes and have some of the strongest potential to devastate a company or organization. White collar crime can be tricky to investigate, as most procedures for investigating misconduct would likely come across the executive\u2019s desk. That\u2019s why employers should consider the discretion of a private investigator for this type of corporate investigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybersecurity<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When there is a breach in your company\u2019s cybersecurity, there must be swift and competent intervention. Your company\u2019s webmasters and I.T. professionals work hard, and there are going to be breaches that they do not know how to address, either due to the sophistication of the breach, or their limited experience with certain types of breaches. When a hacker can invade your company\u2019s website or intranet, those are major patches that must take place as soon as possible. Think of a breach like a wound, and from that open wound, the corporation can continue to leak data, industry secrets, or actual profits. Your corporate investigation must include an investigator with a diverse discipline who can answer crucial questions about the breach\u2014the who, why, and how of the breach, and whether or not the threat is still present and ongoing, or if there has been a proverbial \u201csmash and grab\u201d of the intranet. Skilled investigators will have the appropriate tools and methodology to address these issues and get employers the answers they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harassment<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeated instances of discrimination or sexual harassment are systemic issues that must be addressed in order to prevent costly turnover, training, and decline in corporate culture. Discrimination and harassment not only have internal costs, but can wind up costing the company thousands in legal fees and potentially millions in settlement money if patterns of abuse can be proven in civil court. Discrimination and harassment also have a disastrous effect on workplace culture as targets of the abuse become fearful or uncomfortable in their jobs and the perpetrators continue the same cycle of abuse that causes losses in turnover and loss of employee engagement. Patterns of abuse like this demand a corporate investigation, not only for the sake of the bottom line, but also for the individuals involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge of Imminent State or Federal Investigation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon receipt of a federal subpoena or other indication that there will be an investigation into your business by a government entity, many employers find it prudent to get out ahead of the bureaucratic red tape and get a comprehensive picture of what the government is likely to find. This can lead to prescient legal or public relations strategies that may go a long way in remedying the situation. A corporate investigation into the internal staff, operations, and policies can prepare you for what the investigating agency may find when they comb through the corporation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fraud<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fraud can occur at any level of the employment structure, from entry-level positions all the way up to executives. The strategy for approaching a corporate investigation concerning fraud should change depending on the scope of the fraud and the culprit. This means hiring a corporate investigator with a sophisticated understanding of fraud investigations and how to document the evidence in those cases. Without clear answers and professional solutions to fraud, employers simply don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know. The act of contracting an independent third party to investigate also makes it more difficult for the perpetrator to cover up their actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legal Action<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When facing a civil, criminal, or commercial court case, corporations must apply the same methodology when reacting to an impending investigation by a government body. Independent internal corporate investigations not only provide a veneer of transparency by the corporation in question, but also provides them with an idea of what the plaintiff in the case could conceivably find and use against the defendant in court. &nbsp;This prevents the corporation from being blindsided in an already litigious situation. The more information the corporation has, the better prepared it will be to defend itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whistleblowers<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whistleblowers are every company\u2019s worst nightmare, because not all corporations have operations in place for the contingency of a whistleblower. Thus, when an employee comes forward about misconduct or another internal matter to the press, the fallout can be embarrassing and devastating to the company. Corporate investigations into whistleblowing claims are good-faith efforts to address the concerns raised by the whistleblower in an objective manner. Hiring a private investigator for this corporate investigation can also be a sign of transparency on behalf of the corporation. Comprehensive corporate investigations can also shed light on other issues that might have otherwise been subjected to whistleblowing. Leadership can swiftly intervene and address any problems that might be occurring within their business or organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing when to trigger a corporate investigation can be half the battle. Trust your instincts, and remember that it\u2019s better to be prudent than proud when it comes to your corporate crisis.
