The brain sends signals to the heart to pump vital fluids and maintain the health and fitness of the body in order to grow and develop. In a capitalist world of business and commerce, if a CEO is the brains of a company, certainly Human Resources is the heart. Before any employee can enter a company, they must go through HR, just as vital fluids must pass through the heart before reaching their destination. It is important for Human Resource representatives to be armed with knowledge to allow them to bring in the best and the brightest to contribute to their company. One of the ways HR can rest easy in their hires is by retaining the services of a private investigator to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">voire dire<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the candidate base, maintain a healthy work environment, and prevent employee fraud that would damage the company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Hiring the Right People\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If proper precautions are not taken, hiring a candidate who might soon be terminated can be very costly to a company. Even if the employee is making minimum wage at the time of their termination, a study from <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/surprising-costs-to-the-work-place-2011-11#lost-productivity-due-to-insomnia-costs-companies-3156-per-employee-1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Society for Human Resource Management<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> estimated it can cost as much as $3500 to replace that employee. The higher the level of employment, the costs exponentially increase, with other estimates claiming that it could cost as much as 150% for middle-level employees and 400% for high-level. Therefore, hiring the correct employee on the first attempt can be critical. As the heart of the company, Human Resources are often overwhelmed with a myriad of tasks, which can make the vetting of potential employees fall lower and lower on the list of priorities. This is where the services of a private investigator will prove prudent. Private investigators can use their time and skills to perform background checks on employees, painting a clearer picture for HR representatives. This helps ensure the hiring of proper employees, which minimizes turnover, and greases the wheels of progress within a company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Exposing Workplace Theft<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A report by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/employee-theft-are-you-blind-to-it\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CBS News<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> estimated that a typical business will lose 5% of annual revenue to employee theft. Employee Theft Solutions, a division of the Shulman Center for Compulsive Theft and Spending, has estimated that nearly one third of all corporate bankruptcies were the result of unfettered employee theft. Even more alarming, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimated that 75% of employed persons will steal from their workplace or employer and will continue to steal if not exposed. It is a staggering statistic that should garner scrutiny from the Human Resources department with regards to their own workforce. Bearing in mind that investigating the behavior of a single prospective employee could be very time consuming, imagine having to vet an entire staff in order to uncover a source of theft. With an average of 3-5 cases at any given time, private investigators have the time and access to resources that can help expose the perpetrator of theft in a company. In addition to checking security systems and interviewing witnesses, private investigators also have the advantage of being able to conduct undercover investigations in order to squeeze out the source of theft. These investigative services can help reinforce the wall that prevents employees from devastating a company with fraud.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Fraudulent Compensation Claims<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant portion of the costs incurred annually by employees is attributed to worker\u2019s compensation claims. As a member of Human Resources, it might be easy to trust every single worker compensation claim that comes through the pipeline. After all, yourself or a former superior may have hired the employee, and you trust one another\u2019s respective judgement. However, it is na\u00efve to assume every claim will be legitimate. Worker compensation claims can cost companies hundreds of thousands of dollars per fiscal year depending on the volume of claims. A recent statistic by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in 2014 estimated that it can cost companies as much as a $1.00 per every $100 of employee wages, which can add up very quickly. This is where a private investigator can be a godsend amidst pending litigation. Often in worker compensation claims, interviews are required with the claimant to get their version of events that led up to their injury. While members of Human Resources have many gifts, they may not be skilled in extracting the truth from an employee who might be committing a fraud. Private investigators work to get to the truth every day and can assist the HR department in protecting themselves within the letter of the law. With the resources and due-diligence of a PI vetting the claim, businesses can rest easy knowing that the claims coming through the Human Resources department have merit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>HR Investigation Integrity\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the growing problem of drugs in the workplace and the rise of the #MeToo movement, businesses are having more use for private investigators than ever before. A recent article by CNBC details how a rising number of businesses are hiring private investigators in order to identify predators in their workforce before an employee comes forward with claims of sexual harassment, discrimination, or threats.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;An ounce of prevention is really worth a pound of cure here, because the cost of potential drop in stock price, legal and PR cost \u2014 the possibility of regulators getting involved and regulating industries \u2014 they are enormous compared with the relatively modest expenditure in hiring folks like us in order to rule out this behavior,&#8221; said Nardello, CEO of Nardello &amp; Co.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to identifying these problems to save a business money, it is also imperative that any internal Human Resources department conducts a thorough, prompt, and lawful investigation. Just as private investigators can use their skills to identify predators, they can also protect any HR personnel from compromising the integrity of an investigation, protecting them from legal liability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>An Objective Eye\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human Resources: It\u2019s in the name. Whenever there is a problem between coworkers, a discrepancy in payroll, or simple maintenance of a healthy work environment, the human resources department is where employees will turn to address issues in their job. And while members of HR do their best to solve these problems from an administrating and mediating position, they cannot always be objective. After all, HR is just as much a part of the workforce as any other employee, and all of the same implications of camaraderie and friendship can apply. By the same token, HR can also have negative relationships with the subjects of their investigations, which can influence their judgement. These biases can have a toxic effect on office morale, and employees might not feel as though they can trust Human Resources to be fair and impartial when addressing workplace issues. When there is no trust, the important relationship between HR and other departments breaks down. As is the case with many investigative scenarios, a private investigator is always the perfect second set of eyes to have when examining these issues. Without a stake in the outcome of any internal investigation, private investigators can remain unbiased as they conduct interviews, collect evidence, and reach a conclusion in regards to the veracity of any claim.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important for any Human Resources department to safeguard themselves against the many challenges\u2014both internal and external\u2014they encounter on a daily basis in their company. Retaining the services of a private investigator can go a long way to taking pressure off an already busy department, as well as providing an objective third-party perspective that will positively benefit companies as they grow and develop. If CEOs are the brains of a company and the Human Resources department is the heart, certainly a private investigator would be the immune system; identifying problems and staving off possible infection in order to maintain the health and productivity of any work environment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column_inner][\/et_pb_row_inner][et_pb_row_inner column_structure=&#8221;1_2,1_2&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.1&#8243;][et_pb_column_inner type=&#8221;1_2&#8243; saved_specialty_column_type=&#8221;3_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.1&#8243;][et_pb_social_media_follow _builder_version=&#8221;4.1&#8243;][et_pb_social_media_follow_network social_network=&#8221;facebook&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.1&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#3b5998&#8243; follow_button=&#8221;off&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;on&#8221;]facebook[\/et_pb_social_media_follow_network][et_pb_social_media_follow_network social_network=&#8221;twitter&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.1&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#00aced&#8221; follow_button=&#8221;off&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;on&#8221;]twitter[\/et_pb_social_media_follow_network][et_pb_social_media_follow_network social_network=&#8221;linkedin&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.1&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#007bb6&#8243; follow_button=&#8221;off&#8221; url_new_window=&#8221;on&#8221;]linkedin[\/et_pb_social_media_follow_network][\/et_pb_social_media_follow][\/et_pb_column_inner][et_pb_column_inner type=&#8221;1_2&#8243; saved_specialty_column_type=&#8221;3_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.1&#8243;][et_pb_signup first_name_field=&#8221;off&#8221; last_name_field=&#8221;off&#8221; title=&#8221;Join our Newsletter&#8221; description=&#8221;<p>Your content goes here.
