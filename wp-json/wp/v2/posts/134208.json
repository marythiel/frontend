While such precious treasures may represent a substantial financial investment, they are also often of great sentimental value\u2014inflicting double the wound when they vanish without a trace.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And how common is jewelry theft, you may wonder? Well, the latest jewelry theft statistics paint a grim picture. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/investigate\/violent-crime\/jewelry-gem-theft\">According to the FBI<\/a>, more than $100 million worth of jewelry is stolen each year in the USA. Meanwhile, art theft poses enough of a problem that the FBI has a dedicated Art Crime Team. No doubt, the threat is real to all who act as guardians for prized examples of human creativity\u2014whether what menaces is gallery or jewelry store theft, or the violation of a business premises or private residence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>How Often Is Stolen Jewelry Recovered?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In a jewelry theft investigation, the results can be sort of a mixed bag. Because of the one-of-a-kind nature of many stolen jewelry or art items, when the worst occurs, art or jewelry theft insurance offers little peace of mind. Owners want their beloved pieces back, but sadly the odds are rarely in their favor. Art and jewelry theft stats vary, but together paint a clear picture that the vast majority of precious items are never reunited with their owners.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is in part because law enforcement agencies operating with overstretched resources often have little choice but to prioritize violent crimes. Investigations of stolen jewelry, art, electronics, and other personal valuables sit on the to-do list, or face delays due to bureaucracy or a shifting chain of command. Of course, reporting art and jewelry theft through traditional channels is essential and may result in the victim&#8217;s favor. However many individuals or businesses who have suffered such a loss will be relieved to know that there are other avenues to explore when seeking the return of prized possessions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\"><li><strong>Turning To a Specialized Art and Jewelry Theft Private Investigator<\/strong> <\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When police progress seems to have ground to a halt or one feels that precious time is being wasted, there is another form of art or jewelry theft investigation at your disposal. Uniquely, specialized private investigators are able to pour their complete attention into putting the puzzle pieces together until a clear picture emerges. They also operate independently, objectively, and efficiently on behalf of their clients, while drawing upon a wide variety of resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, this type of private investigator will have a background either directly in law enforcement, or in working alongside such agencies. As such, they will be able to offer a skill set that includes the capacity to profile subjects, canvass for witnesses, and apply forensic methodology to both the crime scene and chain of events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, by seeking out CCTV footage not only from the theft site but also the wider surrounding area, they will diligently strive to map the criminal&#8217;s movements. Meanwhile a jewelry theft investigator may turn to an online jewelry database in their search of clues and monitor online transactions in order to trace the stolen jewelry in question. In fact, licenced private investigators can access many of the same law enforcement databases that a police investigator would.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, whatever stone must be turned to find answers, a jewelry theft private investigator will do so meticulously\u2014identifying the most efficient next step at each case evolution, and documenting evidence as it arises. Because their loyalty is to you as their client, you can also be assured of oversight and control.&nbsp;<br>If you are ready to enlist the assistance of a private investigator after falling prey to the perpetrators of art or jewelry theft, Lauth Investigations International is ever-ready to assist.
