It is a matter of gathering intelligence from publicly available sources and analyzing that information for connections and actionable intelligence that would not be normally publicized. In fact, there may be information about your own company available publicly that can make it easier for someone who is considered an \u201cinsider threat\u201d or conducting a social engineering campaign to obtain proprietary or damaging information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cConducting periodic OSINT for your business, assessing the risks, and addressing vulnerabilities can save a company from failure,\u201d add Lauth. \u201cIt is a recommended and necessary action item for all successful businesses.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSINT is contained in company websites, reviews, Google searches, along with newspapers, geo-location data within images, company reports and other publicly available data. Often overlooked is social media. Companies and employees often provide more information to hackers or \u201cinsider threats\u201d than realized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Criminals can exploit easily obtained information to conduct scams or a social engineering campaign against a business. In fact, criminals use OSINT too \u2013 only for their own devious purposes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To exploit weak links, criminals or \u201cblack hats\u201d can spend weeks, even months researching employee email addresses, current projects, employees that manage money and monitor their social media. They will even study the way employees communicate with each other, gathering the information to create convincing phishing scams and social engineering attacks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information collected to conduct these criminal activities is not obtained by hacking into the company, it is obtained by gathering publicly available information. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cThe trick is to stay one step ahead of the criminals,\u201d said Lauth. \u201cWhen working with clients, we ensure we identify vulnerabilities and the process is conducted effectively, efficiently and confidentially.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line, by exercising due diligence, using OSINT, and reviewing your own publicly available information, you can protect yourself and your company. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By: Kym Pasqualini, Feature Crime Writer for Lauth Investigations Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the collection of data from publicly available sources to be used in the context of intelligence.
