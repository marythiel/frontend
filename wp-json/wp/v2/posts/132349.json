At the onset of the pandemic, most businesses were forced to cease onsite operations in order to comply with the stay-at-home order. While some employees were furloughed due to the changed economic landscape, other employees had their positions transitioned to some form of telecommunication\u2014zoom calls, chat boxes, and email inboxes that have become impossible to clean out. Everything has changed, which has left some working people wondering why working from home is an impossibility in an age where it can help change a corporation\u2019s culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working from home can give an employee a better sense of work-life balance. Everyone who has worked a full-time job has at one time or another craved a greater work-life balance in order to maintain their health and happiness. Many Americans across all industries and tax brackets have expressed some desire to work less for a myriad of reasons. Employees who have never had flexibility in their jobs before are enjoying the flexibility of working from the comfort of their homes. While this is not comforting to all employees, especially ones with children who are also in the home and likely involved in virtual learning, the sudden cushion of their own couch underneath them while working from home makes them wonder why this was never possible before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate culture is the manifestation of the relationship between leadership and their employees. It is sometimes referred to as organizational culture. It concerns how policies and communication from the top of a corporation can directly influence the level of employee engagement and satisfaction at multiple levels of an organization. When a company&#8217;s management does not show initiative to improve operations surrounding these types of complaints, it can create a culture of silence &amp; resentment within the workforce. Healthy corporate culture creates&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/249174\">a cycle of satisfaction<\/a>&nbsp;and productivity that both benefits the bottom line and improves employee engagement for a balanced, stream of operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mandate of working from home has placed some companies on notice, as the situation has exacerbated the stress of many in an already turbulent time. As work and life and work continue to pass over each other, braiding themselves into context with one another, employees are starting<a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/the-cycle-of-corporate-culture\/\"> to expect more care from their employers<\/a> were regards to their corporate culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will always be businesses and business models that cannot support telecommuting as a way of day-to-day operations. Studies have shown that separating work space from living space, the routine of commute and workday operations, the continued face-to-face contact with other employees and how it impacts daily output. Not to mention that every corporation and team is unique. Every work environment is a complex eco-system in its own right\u2014internal structure, policies, how those policies are enforced, leadership, the personalities of all interacting employees\u2014all of these factors creating unique professional experiences. Working from home continues to recontextualize life for working people, and leadership must use this open window to start investing in their corporate culture audit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of a corporate culture audit like a checkup for your business. An investigator comes into the workplace, interviews employees, reviews daily operations and polices, and how those items are enforced. The investigator looks at all of these factors and how they effect the cycle of corporate culture. The investigator then provides leadership with methods to improve their corporate culture by investing in the happiness of their employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find your business is in need of a corporate culture audit, call Lauth Investigations International today for a free quote on our corporate culture audit services.
