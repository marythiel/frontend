Any mistake can lead to serious injuries or even death. For this reason, it&#8217;s crucial for companies to ensure that every worker has the proper qualifications, skills, and a clean record before they are hired. Background checks provide the necessary information to help companies make informed hiring decisions and avoid potential risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over 385,000 injury and illness cases in the manufacturing sector in 2021 alone. This number highlights the importance of prioritizing workplace safety. By conducting thorough workplace investigations, including background checks, companies can significantly reduce the chances of accidents caused by unqualified or risky hires.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-role-of-background-checks-in-workplace-safety\"><strong>The<\/strong><strong> Role of Background Checks in Workplace Safety<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main reasons background checks are essential in the manufacturing industry is their ability to help companies maintain workplace safety. A background check can uncover important details about a candidate\u2019s history, such as criminal records, previous accidents, or substance abuse problems. By identifying these red flags early in the hiring process, companies can prevent potential safety risks from entering their workplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Background checks can also verify whether an applicant has the necessary certifications and licenses required to safely operate machinery or handle dangerous materials. This is particularly important in an industry where employees\u2019 skills can make the difference between a safe day at work and a catastrophic accident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-regulatory-compliance-and-legal-protection\"><strong>Regulatory<\/strong><strong> Compliance and Legal Protection<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to enhancing workplace safety, background checks are also crucial for regulatory compliance. Manufacturing companies are required to follow strict industry regulations to ensure the safety of their employees and the public. Failing to comply with these regulations can lead to heavy fines, legal liabilities, and a damaged reputation. Background checks help companies verify that candidates meet all regulatory requirements, such as having the necessary certifications, and prevent any legal issues that could arise from hiring unqualified workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For companies that hire contract workers or temporary staff, background checks are equally important. Even though contractors may not be full-time employees, they still need to meet the same safety standards. By conducting background checks on all workers, companies can protect themselves from potential risks and ensure that everyone on the job site is qualified and safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-effective-onboarding-and-retention\"><strong>Effective<\/strong><strong> Onboarding and Retention<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Background checks also play a significant role in the onboarding process. By ensuring that new hires are qualified and have a clean record, companies can build a foundation of trust from the start. This trust leads to higher employee retention, as workers feel safer and more valued in an environment that prioritizes workplace safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research has shown that employees are more likely to stay with a company when they feel secure in their roles. By integrating background checks into the hiring and onboarding process, manufacturing companies can reduce turnover and build a more loyal workforce. In turn, this can save companies the high costs associated with hiring and training new employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lauth-investigations-a-trusted-partner-for-hr-support\"><strong>Lauth<\/strong><strong> Investigations: A Trusted Partner for HR Support<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For companies in the manufacturing industry, partnering with a professional background check service is essential.
