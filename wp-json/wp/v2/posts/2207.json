Depending on the size and resources of the company, this is not always possible. Corporate investigations, while necessary, can often be a monumental burden to a small business or organization. Many medium to small businesses\/organizations do not have the budget to conduct a comprehensive, detailed investigation on an internal issue. This leaves them to their own devices in the pursuit of solving the problem. When there is no team in place to solve internal problems, workplace investigations tend to fall on the shoulders of Human Resources personnel. This means that in addition to their regularly scheduled duties, the HR representative must also embark on a deep dive into the internal complaint, covering all their bases with regards to the investigation. If even a small detail is overlooked in internal investigations, it can leave the corporation or organization open to <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/11\/corporate-culture-employee-litigation\/\">wrongful termination lawsuits or other types of litigation<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human resource employees are the salt of the earth within any business or organization. In many circumstances, they are the grease that propels the wheels of progress in internal processes. This means they constantly have multiple projects in-progress and always have a minimal level of supervision for the entire workforce. Factoring in the capacity for human error, mistakes are inevitable in an internal investigation. That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative for human resource employees to have a comprehensive step-by-step plan when initiating internal investigations. While every investigation will be different and may require a different approach, many of the investigative beats follow the same pattern as outlined by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/tools-and-samples\/hr-forms\/pages\/1cms_016311.aspx\">Society for Human Resource Management<\/a>: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Conduct a comprehensive intake interview with\nthe complaining or initial witness, requesting the scaffold information for the\ninvestigation, including the who, what, when, where, how, and why. It\u2019s\nimportant that the employee understand the need for discretion during an open\ninvestigation into the complaint. This reminder for discretion must come with\nthe caveat denoting any confidentiality rules that would infringe upon an employee\u2019s\nrights to discuss their status of employment. <\/li><li>Once the intake interview is conducted, the\ncomplaining witness and other eyewitnesses must put their statements in writing\nto document this stage in the investigation. <\/li><li>Diffuse any flaring tensions within the case. The\nmore elevated the emotions, the more attention that factor of the investigation\nrequires. Even during an investigation into an open complaint, it\u2019s important\nthat employees feel safe in their work environment. The workplace must be stabilized\nand disciplinary action must be reserved until the investigator has the entire\npicture. <\/li><li>Decide if the subject of the investigation\u2014the individual\nwho is named in the complaint\u2014needs to be placed on administrative leave or\nallow voluntary leave during the investigation. It\u2019s important that at all steps\nof this process that any established no-retaliation policies be reinforced. <\/li><li>Identify what other resources are needed to\nconduct this investigation. Regularly consult with in-house counsel regarding\nthe legality of the steps you are taking. <\/li><li>Based on the statements collected at intake,\nidentify the parties that still need to be interviewed and what questions will\nbe asked in that interview. <\/li><li>Interview the accused with the intent to find\nthe truth. Transparency is important at every stage of this investigation, so\nprovide detailed allegations from the complaining employee\u2019s statements, and\nallow the accused to provide comprehensive answers to the questions asked. Ask\nfor witnesses to their version of events. At the conclusion of that interview,\nalways ask if there\u2019s anything else that the accused would like to add. <\/li><li>Re-interview subjects in the case as necessary\npending any new information or evidence. <\/li><li>Keep meticulous notes at all stages of the\ninvestigation. Due to the possibility of litigation following the conclusion of\nthe investigation, it is imperative that transparency be maintained throughout.\nAvoid editorializing in your notes and record only what you are told. Keep\nsecondary performance issues separate from the investigation. <\/li><li>Create a summary of your report based on all of\nthe evidence you\u2019ve gathered and the witnesses you\u2019ve spoken to. Resolve all\nfactual disputes first, moving on next to the emotional factors in the case.\nAgain, be sure to consult in-house counsel at all stages of the investigation. Determine\nthe best course of action at the conclusion of the investigation. Meticulously\ndocument all disciplinary action following the conclusion. Remain alert for\nforms of retaliation on behalf of all parties involved in the investigation. <\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is ill-equipped to conduct an internal investigation, consider hiring a private investigator to find answers. Private investigators can have <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/11\/corporate-culture-audits-why-hire-a-private-investigator\/\">more flexibility than many other types of investigators<\/a>, due to having an average case load of 3-4 cases at one time. Private investigators can also mitigate some of <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/11\/hiring-a-private-investigator-for-your-internal-investigation\/\">the costs of internal investigations<\/a> by conducting a comprehensive investigation with minimal impact to the daily operations of a business or organization.
