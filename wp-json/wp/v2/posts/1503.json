According to the Global Retail Theft Barometer employee theft costs American businesses even more than theft by non-employees. Employee theft made up 43% of all lost inventory in 2015. That\u2019s an annual cost of roughly $18 billion. It\u2019s $2.3 billion more than the cost of theft by customers. Most of the theft that occurs isn\u2019t an employee taking items and walking out of the store with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> \u201cUsually it happens during checkout, when an associate manipulates a transaction to benefit themselves or someone else,\u201d Ernie Deyle, a 30-year veteran of the retail loss-prevention wars who leads the business consulting practice at London-based data analytics firm Sysrepublic told <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/26\/us-retail-worker-theft\/\">F<span class=\"s2\">ortune.com<\/span><\/a>. Employees might, for instance, enter refunds, discounts, or voided transactions into a cash register or \u201ccancel transactions, modify prices, or say someone used a coupon when they didn\u2019t.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> The interesting question, of course, is not so much how as why. \u201cKey reasons \u2026 include ineffective pre-employment screening, less employee supervision, and easy sale of stolen merchandise,\u201d the report says.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> Deyle sees cultural differences at work too. \u201cInternationally, there\u2019s more of an unwritten code that says it\u2019s not honorable to do something dishonest toward an employer,\u201d he says. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a different mindset. There\u2019s so much turnover in retailing, and very little loyalty.&#8221;<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> <\/b>So what can businesses do to combat employee theft and protect their investments? For starters they can invest in a stronger background check system. The reports says one of the key reasons theft happens is due to \u201cineffective pre-employment screening.\u201d Everyone\u2019s trying to cut costs and increase their dividends, but a lack of investment in screening employees thoroughly can end up costing your business more down the line. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> One of the best ways to prevent losing inventory to employee theft is to get your employees involved in the prevention process. Very few people want to be the one to tell the boss about a coworker\u2019s theft. It\u2019s not that they think stealing is ok or don\u2019t care, but who wants to potentially ruin relationships with people you have to work with every day? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Tip lines in 2016 mean more than just 1-800\u00a0telephone numbers. Setting up an email address dedicated to tips allows employees to anonymously report a coworker\u2019s stealing. Everybody text messages nowadays and creating a text message tip line is perfect for younger employees. Tip lines are a great way to empower your employees to report cases of theft without exposing themselves to retaliation from coworkers or the people they report. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Another cause for employee theft is a lack of consistent oversight. Employees don&#8217;t want someone constantly standing over their shoulder, but thinking\u00a0someone is watching them will decrease the rate of employee theft at any business. Cameras are a good option to create the presence of supervision and keep employees mindful of their actions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators can help with every aspect of this and more. Recommending and installing cameras in places most likely to disrupt theft is too easy for a good P.I.. They can also operate the tip lines to make sure every tip is investigated and your employee\u2019s anonymity is protected. Investigators are perfect for higher quality background checks too. Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late. Protect your assets today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Theft in the workplace is a major problem.
