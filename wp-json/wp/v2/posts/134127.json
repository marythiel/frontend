Some <a href=\"https:\/\/teamstage.io\/company-culture-statistics\/\">94% of entrepreneurs and 88% of job seekers<\/a> say that a healthy culture at work is vital for success. Armed with those kinds of numbers, it&#8217;s pretty clear that forging and maintaining top-notch corporate culture should always be a high priority. But, what exactly <em>is<\/em> corporate culture? How can we tangibly measure it and\u2014all importantly\u2014how do we super-charge it, so that our businesses can thrive and prosper?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Defining Corporate Culture<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, to get down to the nitty-gritty of it all, corporate culture\u2014sometimes also known as organizational culture\u2014encompasses an organization&#8217;s values, vision, ethics, work environment, practices, and behaviors. Together, these many facets can make a company stand out; either creating a welcoming or repellent space for employees, and helping to influence public perception for better or worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a business achieves outstanding corporate culture, the results will not only appear upon the smiling faces of its engaged and happy employees, but also in the attraction of high-caliber recruits, the capacity for innovation, the cohesion of teams, and ultimately in surging profits. In contrast, when corporate culture stagnates and festers, it can become a breeding ground for employee misconduct, floundering brand image, high turnover, workplace theft, and even costly litigation. Yikes\u2014best avoided, then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Indicators of Strong Corporate Culture<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Challengingly, building corporate culture isn&#8217;t a case of following a cookie-cutter template. Every business is unique, and pursuing fantastic workplace culture shouldn&#8217;t come at the cost of what makes it so. Instead, whatever the personality of your brand and energy of your organization, the following can be found as markers of great corporate culture\u2014qualities that mold to fit the central company character that incorporates them:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A broad culture of trust and respect<\/li><li>The regular expression of appreciation<\/li><li>High efficiency and performance<\/li><li>Strong multi-directional communication<\/li><li>Resilience in the face of challenge<\/li><li>Team collaboration and cohesion<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Indicators of Corporate Culture in Crisis<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When corporate culture begins to crash and burn, it can be easy to miss the signs. However, when that crisis reaches an advanced stage, there will likely be no area of your business that remains unaffected. If concerned about the corporate culture within your organization, keep an eye out for early indications of the following pervasive issues:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Poor timekeeping<\/li><li>A decline in performance<\/li><li>Escalating workplace theft<\/li><li>Communication silos<\/li><li>Workplace bullying or harassment<\/li><li>High staff turnover<\/li><li>The emergence of workplace cliques<\/li><li>Absenteeism or malingering<\/li><li>Incidents of fraud or white-collar crime<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What To Do When Corporate Culture Gets Off Track<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For any business that wants to stay ahead of the competition and attract the very best talent, shining a spotlight on corporate culture is a must. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/teamstage.io\/company-culture-statistics\/\">86% of job seekers<\/a> will avoid a company with a bad reputation, but the caliber of candidates that a strong corporate culture attracts can generate <a href=\"https:\/\/teamstage.io\/company-culture-statistics\/\">a 33% increase<\/a> in revenue. So, what do you do if some of those warning signs above are starting to appear?<br>A great place to start is with a Corporate Culture Audit. By making a sweeping assessment of all of the factors that both comprise and influence corporate culture, you&#8217;ll be far better equipped to identify strengths and weaknesses, and make a plan to move forwards.
