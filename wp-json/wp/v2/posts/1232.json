Sandline, an Indiana Senator and owner of private investigation firm Jack Sandline and Associates, shared a post on Facebook mocking the women who participated in the \u00a0post inauguration Women\u2019s March as being fat and unmotivated. Sandlin shared a picture of the march which read: \u201cIn one day, Trump got more fat women out walking, than Michelle Obama did in 8 years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The post was quickly deleted, but it was too late. People had already taken screenshots of the post and it began spreading like wildfire. After the post was deleted, a second post appeared on Sandlin\u2019s Facebook wall apologizing, but it was also deleted shortly after. Sandlin told the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.indystar.com\/story\/news\/2017\/01\/23\/indiana-state-senator-under-fire-fat-women-post\/96939462\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Indy Star<\/a> he didn\u2019t make either post, but he allow the possibility that he, \u201c\u2026could have hit something.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is a powerful tool. It can connect you with your audience directly to strengthen your brand. It can also destroy all of your hard work if you post the wrong thing. Here\u2019s a few times people\u2019s social media posts got them into hot water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/23\/arts\/television\/katie-rich-snl-suspended-barron-trump-tweet.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Saturday Night Live Writer is Suspended for Barron Trump Tweet<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s no secret that Saturday Night Live and Donald Trump have an adversarial relationship. Alec Baldwin has been portraying Trump in less than flattering ways ever since Trump announced he was running for president. While SNL has a history of lampooning anyone and everyone, even they had to draw the line when one of their writers tweeted about Trump\u2019s youngest son, Barron.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the day of Trump\u2019s inauguration, SNL writer Katie Rich published a tweet that said, \u201cBarron will be this country\u2019s first homeschool shooter.\u201d The reaction across social media was swift and strong in its condemnation of the tweet. People were outraged Rich targeted a child with an insult.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rich deleted the tweet and even deactivated her Twitter account after the backlash, but it was too late. Executives quickly suspended her for indefinite amount of time for the tweet. Rich\u2019s name was removed from the credits of the following show. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/15\/magazine\/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Justine Sacco Caused a Social Media Meltdown and had no Idea<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Justine Sacco was the director of corporate communications at IAC when she caused a social media meltdown. Sacco was sitting on a plane waiting to take off for Africa when she tweeted, \u201cGoing to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get AIDS. Just kidding. I\u2019m white!\u201d Sacco\u2019s flight took off shortly after the tweet was sent.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sacco didn\u2019t have internet access as she flew and had no idea her tweet was causing the uproar it did. With only 170 followers, it\u2019s unlikely Sacco expected any significant response to her tweet. Unfortunately social media is unpredictable and it\u2019s difficult to know what will and won\u2019t blow up. By the time Sacco\u2019s plane landed, there were numerous blogs calling her a racist and she had lost her job. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcsandiego.com\/news\/local\/Matt-Harrigan-PacketSled-CEO-Trump-Threats-401134605.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PacketSled CEO Resigns after Tweeting Death Threat to Trump<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p>In case you thought only lower level employees would lose their jobs over social media posts, Matt Harrigan is here to prove you wrong. Harrigan was the CEO and President of PacketSled, a network security company before resigning due to some ill advised social media posts.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In multiple posts across his Twitter and Facebook pages, Harrigan wrote about wanting to personally kill Donald Trump. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter and Facebook accounts tied to Matthew Harrigan, the President &amp; CEO of PacketSled, included comments threatening Trump Sunday afternoon, according to an NBC 7 source.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m going to kill the president.
