Johnny took all my documents, including my passport, and led me to his car with two other women,\u201d said Woworuntu.<\/p>\n<p>The driver proceeded to take her to another driver, they exchanged money and demanded they switch cars. This happened three more times. They were taken to a house where they were exchanged, yet again, to a driver with a gun.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter just a few hours in the U.S. I was forced to have sex,\u201d Woworuntu said. \u201cI did what I was told.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The traffickers who participated in Woworuntu\u2019s kidnapping were American, Indonesian, Taiwanese, and Malaysian Chinese. One man even had a police badge though she does not know to this day if he was really an official.<\/p>\n<p>She was then taken up and down I-95, to various brothels, apartment buildings, hotels and casinos on the East coast. Woworuntu said, \u201cI was rarely in the same place, and I never knew where I was going.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The traffickers made her take drugs like meth, cocaine and weed at gunpoint, along with alcohol. Some customers were violent, white guys, black guys, Hispanics guys, old men and even university students.<\/p>\n<p>The traffickers had told Woworuntu she had to pay back $30,000 before freedom would be granted. She would have to service, at least, 300 men to afford this amount. She felt hopeless.<\/p>\n<p>With all the strength she could muster, Woworuntu found an opportunity to escape. She went to police as well as the Indonesian consulate but received no help. She found herself sleeping on the Staten Island Ferry, the NYC Subway and Times Square when a man listened to her story and called the FBI.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, \u201cJohnny\u201d and others were arrested due to Woworuntu\u2019s testimony. Several other women were freed because of Woworuntu\u2019s courage.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the story is now history and Woworuntu is a success story. \u201cThe FBI connected me with Safe Horizon, an organization in New York that helps victims of crime and abuse, including survivors of human trafficking,\u201d said Woworuntu.<\/p>\n<p>The group helped her get housing and secure a job.
