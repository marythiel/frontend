Many executives and other members of leadership simply think of <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/20\/does-your-corporation-need-a-culture-audit\/\">corporate culture<\/a> as what the company stands for. This can be expressed through a corporation\u2019s mission statement, their reported \u201cvision,\u201d or their promise to deliver their customers with the best products and services available. Corporate culture actually goes much deeper, beneath the surface to which the consumer public is privy. The MISTI Training Institute actually defines corporate culture as \u201cthe set of enduring and underlying assumptions and norms that determine how things are actually done in the organization.\u201d It is not enough for leadership to state that they have inspiring beliefs and mission statements, if they do not run corporations to reflect those beliefs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after hearing a more definitive explanation of\ncorporate culture, many executives may still shrug their shoulders and insist\nthat they have a great corporate culture. They think operations are\nstreamlined, employees are engaged, and there are no weak links in the chain.\nThey take solace in the fact that they have things like Taco Tuesdays, or\nCasual Fridays that improve the work environment and keep employees happy.\nWhile these are great ways to foster comradery within the workforce, they are\nband aid solutions to happy employees. The bottom line is: Healthy corporate\nculture begins with happy employees. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/culture-5c-20cy_31417091.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2162 lazyload\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent study conducted by Glassdoor indicates that a majority of working individuals in the United States would prefer a healthy corporate culture to a higher salary or rate of pay. Their day-to-day becomes manageable when they feel as if they are part of a larger team with a greater purpose. This graphic displays the cyclical nature of healthy corporate culture in motion. The cycle begins with happy employees. When trying to improve employee morale, leadership should strongly consider an internal audit of their company\u2019s culture to identify pervasive issues within their corporation\u2019s operating structure. Events like birthday parties for employees, or buying lunch for the office every few weeks are nice gestures by leadership, but they cannot act as solutions to repetitive issues. When these issues are not addressed within the corporation, employees often feel as if their value begins and ends with their productivity, as if they are cogs in a larger machine they cannot control. When leadership actively engages with employee concern on operation issues and makes dedicated and focused attempts to fix them, employees feel as if their voices are heard and their input is valued within the organization. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads to improved engagement on behalf of those valued\nemployees. They are prompt to work, freshly-groomed and instilled with a sense\nof purpose as their co-workers progress with them towards the organization\u2019s\ngoal. The level of communication between employees will not only improve in\nquality, but the rate of response to correspondence also has the potential to\nincrease dramatically, because the employees are engaged in the process and are\neager to complete tasks on time\u2014possibly even early. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once employee engagement is up, leadership can expect to see\nan increase in the productivity of the workforce as a whole. Engaged employees\napproach their task with the confidence of a professional, and the confidence\nthat comes from the feeling of support within the organization. Studies have\nshown that productivity can increase by as much as 28% when a corporation\u2019s\nculture is given a major overhaul. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When productivity increases, everybody in the company\nbenefits. Having their requisites satisfied, leadership can let their focus\nextend beyond daily operations. This expanded scope of supervision leads to\nhigher engagement on behalf of leadership, which feeds back into a healthy work\nenvironment in which they are happy to reward the stellar performance of their\nemployees. When employees feel their work is valued, the cycle begins anew. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shared body of beliefs that the company claims to have\nin the public eye should go all the way to the CEO and be directly reflected in\nthe day to day operations of the company. When leadership remains plugged in\nand continues to expand the scope of their supervision, internal issues cannot\npervade within the workplace. In healthy work environments, the level of\nimprovement that can occur week to week will only serve the company\u2019s larger\ngoals. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Culture can be the beginning and end of your company.
