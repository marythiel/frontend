Keep your employees safe<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> <\/b>Keeping employees safe is the humber one priority for most businesses. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/cfoi.nr0.htm\">According<\/a> to the United Stated Department of Labor Occupational Health and Safety Administration, 2 million workers report being the victim of workplace violence every year. 4,679 fatal workplace injuries happened in 2014 with 749 of those deaths being ruled homicides. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Protecting your business from the threat of violence must be a top priority in order to create a safe and productive space for your employees. Employees shouldn&#8217;t be anxious about their safety and neither should you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Increased emphasis on pre-employment background checks can keep potentially violent people off of a company\u2019s payroll. Annual background checks of current employees will help detect changes or rising threat levels before anything bad can take place. Private investigators can screen employees for red flags and let you know about them before it\u2019s too late.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>2. Save money through employee retention<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> <\/b>\u201cWhere do you see yourself in five years?\u201d Some form of that question is asked in every single interview across America. Businesses don\u2019t want to hire people for the short term. They want people that will stick around and be part of their company for years to come. Long term employees bolster company culture and cohesion. They also save businesses money on training costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> The Center for American Progress<a href=\"https:\/\/templatearchive.com\/cost-of-turnover\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> reported<\/a> in 2012 that the average cost to replace an employee fell between 10% and 30% of that employee\u2019s annual salary. Searching for new employees sucks time and money from other activities managers could be working on. Improved background checks will protect any company\u2019s investments by helping them make the right choice the first time they fill a position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>3. Protect your assets<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> <\/b>Employee theft is a major problem for businesses. Costing up to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/26\/us-retail-worker-theft\/\">$18 billion <\/a>annually, everything that can be done to prevent employee theft must be done. Companies won\u2019t always know before hiring someone if they&#8217;re more likely to commit theft, but expansive background checks can help detect early warning signs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Credit checks are an excellent indicator of an increased risk of theft. For years the government and military have run credit checks on all personnel seeking security clearances. The higher someone\u2019s debt and lower the credit, the higher their chances of being compromised by financial gain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Has the employee stolen before? Do their former coworkers consider them honest? Beyond credit checks, a deep look at past employment can help indicate if someone might steal. Private investigators can find all this information and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>4. Investigate social media history to prevent going viral for the wrong reasons<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> <\/b>Going viral is all the rage for companies in 2016. Everyone wants to be the talk of social media and to trend on FaceBook and Twitter. Companies spend a lot of money on marketing and promotion aimed at creating the next online sensation. But what happens when you go viral for all the wrong reasons?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> in 2012, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/lists\/a-brief-history-of-people-getting-fired-for-social-media-stupidity-20150713\/the-bartender-who-called-black-people-un-hirable-20150713\">Jessica Harr<\/a> was a bartender for Proof Nightclub in Chicago when her Facebook page regrettably caused the club to become the talk of the internet. In an extremely racist FaceBook post Harr described African Americans as \u201cignorant\u201d \u201cstupid,\u201d and \u201capes.\u201d Harr even swore she\u2019d never hire an African American for those reasons. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> The post quickly went viral and numerous people threaten to boycott the club. Other club owners came out and said they\u2019d had issues dealing with Proof Nightclub as well. Harr was quickly fired, but Proof\u2019s brand was damaged and they had to commit serious time and money to repairing their identity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> In the age of social media, companies cannot afford to ignore their employee\u2019s social media pages. One post is all it takes to stoke outrage and retaliation against a business for those they employ. If your background checks don\u2019t include extensive online research then you need to make a change fast. Protect your brand and go viral for the right reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>5. Trouble with past employers <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b> <\/b>When companies interview job candidates it\u2019s important they not only verify their work history, but investigate it as much as possible. Verifying the dates of employment is a good start, but finding out how the candidate interacted with coworkers and management is vital to thorough vetting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"> Private investigators are perfect for building a profile of any candidate to better evaluate their chances of success if hired. Was the candidate considered a team player at their last job? Did they show up early and leave late or cut corners to get out as quick as possible? Don\u2019t waste your time on employees who won\u2019t give your company 100%. Find out who they are before you pay them for who you think they might be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hiring the right employees can save businesses time and money.
