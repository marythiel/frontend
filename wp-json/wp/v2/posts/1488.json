Whether the drug happens to be alcohol, prescription medication or illegal substances, and regardless of whether the use is occurring during working hours or on the employee\u2019s personal time, the results can include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decreased performance<\/li>\n<li>Increase in tardiness and absenteeism<\/li>\n<li>Lower productivity<\/li>\n<li>Higher employee turnover<\/li>\n<li>Increase in expenses associated with medical care and workers\u2019 comp<\/li>\n<li>Increased risk of workplace violence<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Not only do these things affect the employee in question and the company as a whole, but they can also have a negative impact on other employees, leading to a host of other problems. To avoid this, management and those in HR must be proactive and vigilant so potential issues can be addressed swiftly and effectively. If you suspect that one or more of your employees may be abusing drugs, here are 7 steps to get the situation under control.<\/p>\n<p><b>Develop a Clear-Cut Policy<\/b> \u2013 In order to legally take action against a worker who is abusing drugs or alcohol, you must first have a policy in place that addresses such situations. For optimum results, your employee drug abuse policy should include the ability to test in the event of reasonable suspicion. The policy should be in writing and all employees should sign off acknowledging their understanding and agreement. If you don\u2019t have such a policy in place, consult with your legal counsel to ensure proper implementation.<\/p>\n<p><b>Watch for Warning Signs<\/b> \u2013 An employee who is abusing drugs or alcohol may not always be blatantly intoxicated. Therefore, it\u2019s important to know what warning signs and red flags may indicate possible employee drug abuse so they can be identified and tracked. Some common things to watch for include sudden change in behavior, excessive tardiness or sick days, withdrawal from others (i.e. the sudden desire to work alone, away from co-workers and\/or supervision).<\/p>\n<p><b>Train Those in Charge<\/b> \u2013 HR representatives may not be able to identify the signs of potential drug abuse right away because they aren\u2019t in direct contact with workers in every department. That\u2019s why front-line managers should be properly trained and advised of their role in spotting red flags as well as the appropriate steps for documenting and reporting such suspicions.<\/p>\n<p><b>Keep a Detailed Record<\/b> \u2013 Employment laws protect workers from being unjustly disciplined or terminated, so be sure to do your due diligence. Any and all cases of suspected employee drug abuse should be clearly documented. This will help you establish your case and protect you from any potential backlash.<\/p>\n<p><b>Meet with a Witness<\/b> \u2013 Once a case of suspected employee drug abuse has been properly observed and documented, the next step is meeting with the worker in question to discuss the suspicions and a proposed plan of action. A witness should always be present to keep detailed notes and provide a third-party account of what occurs. Go over your company policy and discuss the appropriate next steps.<\/p>\n<p><b>Test (When Allowed)<\/b> \u2013 It\u2019s important to note that drug testing is a legal issue and therefore should always involve the advice and\/or guidance of an appropriate legal representative. Provided that you have the authority to legally do so, follow through with drug testing, either at designated intervals or when a suspicion arises.<\/p>\n<p><b>Take Action<\/b> \u2013 Depending on the regulations in your area, as well as what\u2019s set forth in your company policy, the appropriate action should be taken when suspected employee drug abuse occurs. This may be a warning, a suspension or termination of employment. Remember to always stay within your legal rights based on what the employment laws in your state allow. When in question, always consult with a legal professional.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, some companies find it too tedious to follow up on suspected employee drug abuse. If you find yourself in this boat, enlisting the help of an experienced private investigator can help alleviate some of the burden and help you focus on what\u2019s most important: protecting your other employees and your reputation.
