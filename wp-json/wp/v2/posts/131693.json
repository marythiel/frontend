The answer\nis complicated. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employee malingering is becoming a problem for some employers. As some states move forward with plans to open their states back up during <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/05\/27\/politics\/100000-deaths-moment-of-reflection\/index.html\">the global COVID-19 pandemic<\/a>, many are looking forward to life returning to some semblance of normalcy. While businesses make plans to reopen their doors, there are others that will keep the bulk of their operations remote with employees working from home in order to mitigate the spread of the disease. While many employers feel this precaution is still prudent, there is the additional layer of anxiety about whether employees are keeping their noses to the grindstone, or malingering. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, these are strange times. A majority of businesses\nin the United States were forced to shut down direct business to customer\noperations in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Employees who were\nnot furloughed or laid off due to COVID-19 have been forced to adjust to a new\nworking life devoid of work-life balance\u2014their work is literally in the home\u2014complete\nwith the distraction of children, family, pets, spouses, and other household\ndistractions. It is a stressful time, and it can be difficult to maintain focus.\nCorporations and organizations should always prioritize their employee\u2019s mental\nhealth for the sake of their corporate culture. These predictable challenges\nwith suddenly working from home should not be considered employee malingering. However,\nwillful malingering can lay huge blows to daily productivity and ultimately\nprofits. Employers must have a way to verify whether or not their employees are\nactually working. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under more normal, stable circumstances, employers have the\nbenefit of face to face interaction for determining how engaged and productive\ntheir employees are. In addition to output, supervisors can note how many\nbreaks they take, the quality of the work, and the level of communication from the\nemployee, both on and offline. However, remote working has made detecting\nemployee malingering almost impossible. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telecommunication technology has played a vital role in facilitating\nthe continuation of the economy despite the quarantine. Meetings are held over Zoom,\nemployee time is tracked through invoices or through an online time clock of\nsorts that allows employees to log their time worked and have their timesheets\nstored on a cloud server. Short of a live camera feed that documents the\nemployee in front of the computer or on the phone, is there truly a way to\nverify if they are actually working? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of hiring a private investigator to surveil your\nemployees may sound strange or even wrong, but it\u2019s a highly common business\npractice that legally exposes the drain an individual employee might be having\non your company. Private investigators can track an employee\u2019s movements during\nthe time they have invoiced or logged, ensuring that any errands outside the\nhome are work-related and have some value to the corporation. Private\ninvestigators can document these movements with GPS trackers placed under their\ncar, photographing their activities in public to either prove or disprove\nemployee malingering. Private investigators are trained to blend in with their\nsurroundings, and conduct surveillance discretely to prevent their cover from\nbeing blown, so in the event that no employee malingering is found, no one is\nthe wiser. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you suspect your employee is malingering on your dime, reach out to Lauth Investigations International today for a free quote on our surveillance services.
