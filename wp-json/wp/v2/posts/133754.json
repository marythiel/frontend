Internal processes must be reviewed and evaluated by an internal investigator. It may be necessary to interview employees regarding their knowledge of the matter\u2014those accounts must be cataloged, transcribed, and placed in context within the investigation. In addition to the tangible resources that are expended during the investigation, there\u2019s hundreds of hours of labor hours that must be invoiced and paid out. The <a href=\"https:\/\/i-sight.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/The-Economics-of-Internal-Investigations.pdf?x46490\">Fulbright Litigation Trends Survey<\/a> presented data that indicated internal investigation costs were already on the rise back in 2011. Excluding the cost of settlements and judgements, they reported a median spend with American corporations of $1.4 million. Almost a quarter of those businesses reporting spent an excess of $5 million or more regarding internal complaints. For large companies with a wealth of resources, $5 million may seem like a drop in the bucket, but there are many smaller businesses who could easily be bankrupted by such a price tag. Those same companies also do not have the budget to maintain a specialized internal investigations team to address internal complaints when they arise. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a wide variety of events that could trigger a corporate investigation. Perhaps an employee files a sexual harassment complaint against another. Perhaps a whistleblower brings attention to a pervasive internal problem. Whatever the cause, it\u2019s up to leadership within the corporation or organization to ensure that the problem is addressed. While some entities have the budget for an internal investigation team, the investigation itself still places a strain on a business and its resources. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/11\/corporate-culture-audits-why-hire-a-private-investigator\/\">Private investigators<\/a> are the perfect professionals to conduct your corporation\u2019s culture audit for a number of reasons. Just to name a few, private investigators have similar skill sets to investigators who work in risk assessment, can conduct internal investigations without disruption, and can offer you a more customizable program that will fit your business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private investigators build successful practices because\nthey have a detailed eye for human behavior. When it comes to private\ninvestigation, it\u2019s not always just about what a subject is doing, but also why\nthey\u2019re doing it. Because they have a wealth of experience in rationalizing and\npredicting human behavior, private investigators might have an edge over\ntraditional corporate culture audits performed by risk assessment investigators.\nWhat we know about the cycle of corporate culture indicates that there is a\ncause\/effect relationship between an employee\u2019s level of engagement and how\nsuccessful the company or organization is in their internal operations. We also\nknow that an organization\u2019s structure can directly affect how engaged employees\nare. This is why private investigators are so invaluable. They can look at\ncharacteristics of the workforce on paper <em>and<\/em> in real life to assess how\nemployees feed into the current cycle of corporate culture. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Risk assessment firms specialize in internal investigation,\nbut too often, leadership will neglect undergoing an audit because they believe\nthat it will be too much a daily disruption to internal operations. By virtue\nof their profession, private investigators excel at blending in to their\nenvironment, whether it\u2019s in a busy street, or a quiet library. Whatever the\nnature of their investigation, private investigators know how to conduct their\ndue-diligence without drawing attention to themselves or others. This skillset\nis especially valuable if leadership wishes to conduct a covert internal\ninvestigation. After all, people behave the most naturally when they believe they\naren\u2019t being watched. In this way, private investigators can infiltrate businesses\nand obtain necessary information without piquing the curiosity or suspicion of\ncurrent employees. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another hallmark of a private investigation\u2019s profession is their flexibility and autonomy. Sometimes private investigators can very quickly pick up leads that other investigators cannot because they have autonomy other types of investigators do not. This flexibility gives private investigators the ability to customize any corporate culture audit program to fit your business\u2019s needs. Some companies may be small, but do not have the traditional structure of a brick-and-mortar business. Other companies might be large, but have a workforce where millennials dominate the majority. This is where a private investigator\u2019s diverse experience can allow them to identify the problems and prioritize the most prevalent problems to right <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/08\/the-cycle-of-corporate-culture\/\">the ship of corporate culture.<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business or organization needs a corporate culture\naudit, call Lauth Investigations International today for a free quote on our\ncorporate culture audit program.
