An aura of austerity and secrecy develops as the top decision-markers close ranks and circle the wagons to protect the interests of the university. No one usually thinks of universities as corporations, but they do bring in billions of dollars per year throughout the United States, much of that cash flow coming from private donors whose interests must also be protected during the investigation. Private investigators can take the same skillsets that allow them to expose misconduct within a corporation and apply them to university investigations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Corporate investigations vs. university investigations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>University investigations are rather common, though the investigation type is not always the same. When it comes to intelligence operations, private universities as an entity are a proverbial garden of opportunities for private investigators to apply their trade. There are two principal pools where the crime and misconduct are found. There\u2019s the student body, who finds time for socializing and partying when they\u2019re not hitting the books. Crimes committed within the student body may not be easily closed, either because the students involved or the university itself are not cooperating. The other common pool of opportunity is in the university faculty. While a university is not strictly a corporation, they experience similar workplace environments and are subject to the same workplace dynamics as businesses or nonprofits. There\u2019s harassment between coworkers, financial misconduct, other forms of fraud, bribery, and collusion. These are all opportunities for private investigators to apply their methodology in a way that can improve a university for both the faculty and the student body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sexual assault investigations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who has ever seen a Dick Wolf police procedural knows that one of the most common crimes associated with universities is sexual assault. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rainn.org\/statistics\/campus-sexual-violence\">RAINN<\/a>, the country\u2019s largest organization combatting sexual violence estimates \u201c11.2% of all students experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation.\u201d Sexual violence on campuses is pervasive and it is not uncommon for the university police to be ill-equipped or unwilling to help. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.invw.org\/sexual-assault\/https:\/www.invw.org\/sexual-assault\/\">InvestigateWest<\/a> calls the phenomenon \u201ca culture of indifference.\u201d If the survivor then supersedes campus police and reports the assault to their local police department, a faulty investigation on behalf of campus police\u2014either intentionally or otherwise\u2014can severely impact the police\u2019s investigation. This often leaves survivors with no recourse for justice, and are often compelled to continue attending classes in the same vicinity as their alleged attacker. This extends not only to student-on-student assault, but also between faculty and student, with even more devastatingly high stakes for the university as well as the survivor. Repeated instances in which the university ultimately shields the accused and displays documented negligence in properly investigating the survivor\u2019s allegations can constitute a pattern of misconduct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Violence, vandalism and theft<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While sexual assault is one of the most serious and heinous crimes associated with campus life and work, there are other issues of student misconduct that require proper investigative methodology that campus police or local law enforcement might be ill-equipped to handle. Things such as theft, vandalism, stalking, and other forms of violence can also go unchecked if not properly investigated. When a victim has no recourse from other authorities, a private investigator can be the perfect professional to provide crucial context. Their proficiency in running comprehensive background checks and locating subjects, private investigators can make contact with elusive persons of interests in university investigations. Private investigators can go undercover, documenting behavior and actions that might otherwise be concealed. Private investigators also have an investigative edge over law enforcement. Though they are licensed and bonded by the states, private investigators are still private citizens. Young adults ages 18-24 typically have a great deal to lose in university investigations, including financial loss, loss of scholarships or grants, expulsion, arrest, and fallout with their families. This fosters a pattern of noncooperation with law enforcement in order to minimize consequences for themselves and their friends. Another critical factor is that underage drinking and illegal drug use are synonymous with campus culture, which could prompt additional consequences. However, private investigators have no powers of arrest, which can lead to the cooperation of subjects in university investigations. This dislodges any roadblocks in case progression, increasing the likelihood of a solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Faculty subjects in university investigations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Describing the impact of the crimes previously described become exponentially more devastating when you expand the pool of perpetrators to university faculty and staff. Furthermore, the level of noncooperation with investigating bodies when it comes to university investigations typically increases when it involves a staff member, and is proportional to their role within the university. The college admissions scandal in 2019, involving high profile defendants Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, showed everyone how much bad press universities can get when misconduct is exposed on the national stage, and universities are invested in minimizing such exposure. They stand to lose endorsements, contracts, sponsorships, and drops in enrollment rates as students and parents refuse to participate in an application process that has proven to be financially rigged. Private investigators can apply the same investigative methodology used in <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/\">corporate investigations<\/a> and apply it to university investigations. Undercover operations, surveillance operations, witness location, and evidence gathering are all services that private investigators use to expose misconduct within organizations, and universities are no exception. In addition to the crimes previously described, employee misconduct in university investigations such as fraud, embezzlement, bribery, admissions fraud, racism, and sexual harassment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring a private investigator adds an additional degree of integrity to university investigations. Because private investigators are independent of the university and law enforcement, their findings stand up to a higher degree of scrutiny at the conclusion of an investigation and in a court of law. Because private investigators are not bound by jurisdiction or by a chain of command, they are usually better equipped to push back against noncooperation in university investigations.
