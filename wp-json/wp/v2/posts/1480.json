She decided to remain on the island and have the child in order to keep the secret to herself. On February 4th, 1981,\u00a0her daughter Katherine was born at Kapiolani Medical Center. Although it was a difficult choice, it was the one that made sense at the time.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_833\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/khon2.com\/2015\/01\/01\/mother-daughter-return-to-hawaii-after-decades-apart\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-833\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-833 lazyload\" alt=\"Photo via KHON\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/family-reunion-baby-photo-300x168.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 300px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 300\/168;\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-833\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo via <a href=\"http:\/\/khon2.com\/2015\/01\/01\/mother-daughter-return-to-hawaii-after-decades-apart\/\">KHON<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I was ready to be a parent,\u201d Gille admitted.\u00a0\u201cBut, February 4th always had a special significance for me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Gille returned to her life back on the mainland, never discussing the heartbreak of having to give up her child. After decades of wondering what ever became of Katherine, Gille finally contacted private investigator Hilton Lui to help her reunite with her <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/missing-persons-investigations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">missing daughter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The search, which took them back to Hawaii and eventually to Australia, found Katherine (now Katherine Gray) alive and well &#8211; and a mother of her own.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI see a tremendous sense of joy of something that was such a shameful secret in my life for more than three decades to have turn into such a thing of beauty,\u201d Gille said in an interview with <a href=\"http:\/\/khon2.com\/2015\/01\/01\/mother-daughter-return-to-hawaii-after-decades-apart\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KHON television station<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>The Story of Adoption Investigation<\/h3>\n<p>The story of Nancy Gille and Katherine Gray is not uncommon. Despite the years and circumstances of an adoption, many children and birth parents wonder what has become of the other. Often, adoptive parents are interested in knowing a child&#8217;s medical history which can only be obtained by connecting with the biological parent.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this information is not always easy to find. According to the Adoption Information Act, parents who enable their right to a confidential or &#8220;closed&#8221; adoption are provided security so that a birth child or parent can&#8217;t contact them later in life. In other instances, birth mothers can sometimes be coerced into giving up their parental rights or rights to contact, especially if they are younger. This can make finding birth parents and biological children incredibly difficult.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_830\" style=\"width: 353px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Screen-Shot-2015-05-04-at-8.42.25-AM.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-830\" class=\"wp-image-830 lazyload\" alt=\"Gille and Gray reflect on what's it like to connect with the past.

An excellent example is Gille and Gray. Even though both parties were interesting in finding and connecting, the span of time and lack of documentation made it virtually impossible to be reunited. It wasn&#8217;t until hiring Liu that reunification became a possibility and then a wonderful reality.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI still pinch myself to believe that, you know, this is my daughter.
