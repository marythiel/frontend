According to a 2024 survey conducted by The National Transportation Institute (NTI), the percentage of women student drivers and trainees has shrunk to 10.7%, a sharp drop from the more promising 15% seen just two years ago. This setback reflects a broader issue affecting efforts to increase diversity &amp; inclusion within the transportation sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leah Shaver, the President and CEO of NTI, voiced her disappointment with the findings, stating that the industry\u2019s progress in attracting more women and younger individuals to the trucking profession has stalled. The data indicates that the workforce&#8217;s composition has regressed to levels seen in 2019, where only 10.1% of student drivers and trainees were women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/lauthinvestigations.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/A_White_Truck_Driving_On_Road_At_Sunset_original_1731488-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-166394\" srcset=\"https:\/\/lauthinvestigations.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/A_White_Truck_Driving_On_Road_At_Sunset_original_1731488-980x551.jpg 980w, https:\/\/lauthinvestigations.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/A_White_Truck_Driving_On_Road_At_Sunset_original_1731488-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-step-back-in-gender-representation\"><strong>A<\/strong><strong> Step Back in Gender Representation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 2020 and 2022, women represented around 8% of the trucking workforce. However, that figure has since dropped to below 7% in 2023, indicating a return to pre-2020 numbers. The Women In Trucking Index similarly found that the number of women truck drivers had declined to 9.5%, down from approximately 12.1% in the previous year. This reduction in representation comes as fleets have slowed recruitment efforts due to a prolonged freight downturn, according to Shaver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These findings highlight the importance of diversity &amp; inclusion initiatives in the transportation sector. The lack of sustained progress points to the need for a renewed focus on addressing barriers faced by underrepresented groups, particularly women. For years, the trucking industry has faced a persistent shortage of drivers, making it even more critical to encourage a broader and more diverse pool of candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-identifying-barriers-to-entry\"><strong>Identifying<\/strong><strong> Barriers to Entry<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) has identified removing barriers to entry for women truck drivers as a top priority. In a report released in June 2024, ATRI highlighted some of the challenges that women face in the industry, including safety concerns, harassment &amp; discrimination, and a lack of adequate training and mentorship. These factors can discourage women from pursuing careers in trucking, contributing to the industry&#8217;s diversity &amp; inclusion challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, EEOC compliance and investigations have become critical tools for addressing issues related to harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Ensuring that trucking companies adhere to federal guidelines not only fosters a more inclusive environment but also helps mitigate the legal risks associated with non-compliance. Lauth Investigations International, a trusted leader in corporate investigations, offers expert services to help organizations navigate these complex challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-role-of-corporate-investigations\"><strong>The<\/strong><strong> Role of Corporate Investigations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trucking companies face a variety of harassment and discrimination issues, both in the hiring process and on the job. Bias or unfair treatment can lead to costly EEOC investigations and lawsuits if not addressed proactively. To maintain EEOC compliance and avoid legal pitfalls, companies must create an inclusive culture that promotes diversity and supports all employees, regardless of gender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lauth Investigations International specializes in corporate investigations that help companies identify and resolve issues related to diversity &amp; inclusion, as well as harassment &amp; discrimination.

Trucking companies must address the barriers that discourage women from pursuing these careers, including safety concerns, harassment and discrimination, and a lack of support systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring EEOC compliance is also essential, as failure to do so can lead to costly EEOC investigations.
