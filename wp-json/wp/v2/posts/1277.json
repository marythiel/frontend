Most people have some form of social media an enterprising sleuth could build a profile based off of just by pressing the \u201colder posts\u201d button. There\u2019s been a lot of news about wiretaps lately, but something under most people\u2019s radar are the Smart TV\u2019s and toys that have been listening to their owner\u2019s conversations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s scary enough to consider how many things in your home could be listening in on you this very moment, what\u2019s even more concerning is how quickly you can lose control of these devices and extorted to get them back. And it\u2019s not just individuals having their devices and data taken from them, it\u2019s also hit schools, hospital and private businesses hard over the last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common forms of extortion today is the use of \u201cransomware\u201d to lock people or companies out of their electronics and data. Ransomware is a term for a particular kind of hacking that\u2019s been on the rise as internet reliance has increased. Victims of ransomware typically receive a message on their device\u2019s display saying something to the effect of \u201cpay us this money and we\u2019ll give you back your data.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/04\/04\/technology\/ransomware-cybercrime\/index.html?iid=EL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interview<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0with CNN, South Carolina public school administrator Charles Huck, highlighted the dilemma presented by ransomware when he said, \u201cYou get to the point of making the business decision: Do I make my end-users \u2014 in our case teachers and students \u2014 wait for weeks and weeks and weeks while we restore servers from backup? Or do we pay the ransom and get the data back online more quickly?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the targets of ransomware want their systems or data back then they don\u2019t have much choice, but to pay the fee. The hackers have repeatedly targeted hospitals since their technology working is literally a case of life or death there is significant pressure on the hospitals to simply pay the ransom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center had some of it\u2019s communication devices taken over by hackers last year, the criminals demanded $17,000 to be paid in bitcoin. The hackers asked for that amount, because it\u2019s low enough most places will pay under the impression it\u2019s the quickest way to get it all over with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe malware locks systems by encrypting files and demanding ransom to obtain the decryption key. The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,\u201d Chief Executive Allen Stefanek said when the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/technology\/la-me-ln-hollywood-hospital-bitcoin-20160217-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LA Times<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0asked why they paid the hackers. \u201cIn the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the scarier things about ransomware is this is only the beginning. The FBI reported ransomware to be a $1 billion industry in 2016. In a <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/04\/15\/technology\/ransomware-cyber-security\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">follow-up story<\/a><\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CNN reported:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At that rate, ransomware is on pace to be a $1 billion a year crime this year. The FBI told CNN that the number &#8220;is quite high&#8221; because a few people &#8220;reported large losses.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The agency also said that the losses could even be bigger once other related costs from these extortion schemes are factored in. Plus: Some victims may choose to pay and not report the crime.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paul Roberts, founder and editor of a website called The Security Ledger told CNN, &#8220;The ransomware criminals understand this. Their business in some ways is a volume business so they don&#8217;t set their ransom so high that you can&#8217;t pay it. They set it at a level so they can get their money and move on to the next victim.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This crime has even made its way into consumer electronics like smart phones and TVs. Last Christmas a photo of an LG TV stricken with ransomware went viral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1278\" src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Screen-Shot-2017-03-19-at-9.21.13-PM-275x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"425\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hackers demand far less money to relinquish control of personal devices, but $500, especially if it\u2019s on Christmas Day after you\u2019ve spent money on gifts, is still a lot. In December, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/darrencauthon\/status\/813096722989809665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slate<\/a><\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cRansomware works by taking over a system until a user pays a fee, often in the form of cryptocurrency or digital gift cards. One recent high-profile ransomware attack shut down much of San Francisco\u2019s public transit system while another targeted a Hollywood hospital. More mundane ransomware has been reported on Android devices since at least 2014, and Frantic Locker first began to show up on phones in 2015.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your systems operating systems up to date and don\u2019t download files that aren\u2019t from \u00a0trusted site to help avoid ransomware. If you do all these things and still end up under attack, contact your systems administrator or the manufacturer of your device. Take precaution, because ransomware isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We expose more of ourselves on a daily basis than at any other time in history.
