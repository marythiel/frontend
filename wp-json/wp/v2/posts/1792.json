On the day he disappeared, he was left in the care of his father\u2019s girlfriend, Emily Glass. In the missing persons report, Glass told investigators on February 17<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, 2018, she saw Lucas playing in his room around three in the afternoon. She then took a shower and fell asleep. When she awoke around six in the evening, Lucas was nowhere to be found.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law enforcement in Wichita investigated for months, unearthing no credible leads into Lucas\u2019 disappearance. Months later, on May 24<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, locals were shocked after a private investigator blew the case wide open by informing law enforcement Emily Glass had led them to the decomposing remains of little Lucas under a nearby bridge. Why would Glass, after dealing with law enforcement for months, only then break her silence regarding her knowledge of the little boy\u2019s body? The answer is as simple as this: Private investigators have advantages law enforcement do not when it comes to conducting concurrent independent investigations in criminal and missing persons cases. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how is a private investigator\u2019s approach different from the approach of a local, state, or federal law enforcement agency? The first thing to consider is the caseload of most law enforcement agencies. From the moment an initial report is made, in both criminal and missing persons cases, law enforcement have the meticulous and overwhelming task of gathering evidence to build a case that will secure justice on behalf of the victims and the state. Crime scenes need to be mined for evidence by medical examiners and crime scene technicians. Detectives and other investigators need to canvass witnesses\u2014sometimes dozens of people\u2014in the area who might have seen or heard something. Now imagine the workload of one case multiplied by 40 or 50 times. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.evawintl.org\/PAGEID31\/Best-Practices\/FAQs\/Caseloads\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An audit conducted in Portland Oregon in 2007<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reviewed law enforcement data from Portland itself, and nine other surrounding cities, to conclude the average caseload for a detective in Portland was a median of 54. This is compared to a 5-year average of 56 cases. Knowing statistics like these are similar in law enforcement agencies all across the country, it\u2019s easy to see how the progress of cases might slow to a crawl. Agencies are overwhelmed, and this is where private investigators have the advantage. Private investigators may only handle one or two cases at a time, giving them their full focus and attention. Wichita law enforcement might have faced similar challenges of an overwhelming caseload when it came to investigating Lucas Hernandez\u2019s disappearance.

It seems counter-intuitive that a private investigator may use the same tools as law enforcement, ask the same questions, and may even come to the same conclusion as law enforcement without the ability to arrest a suspect for the crime. However, the case of Hernandez showcased exactly why a private investigator\u2014and their inability to arrest\u2014broke the case wide open.
