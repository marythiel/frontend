The language of your workplace might be changing\nand evolving. The new hires appear to look younger and younger every day. As millennials\nage, we will see a rising trend in places of business being dominated by millennial\nculture and influence, and that just might be the answer to a necessary major\noverhaul of corporate culture throughout the United States. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Baby Boomer generation used to be the largest generation\ncurrently employed in the United States. As they start to retire and leave the\nworkforce, the road is paved and shiny for millennials to fill those positions.\nSince 2016, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbestechcouncil\/2019\/09\/30\/how-gen-z-could-change-corporate-culture-and-how-we-can-keep-up\/#6a93e03d64ca\">millennials\nhave made up a majority of the American labor force<\/a>, and American work\nenvironments are seeing the signs of progression. Millennials are an inspired\nand ambitious generation, despite their reputation for lacking initiative and\nbeing obsessed with the latest tech. Their most notable trait however is their\nstandards for corporate culture. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Millennials\u2014more than any other generation\u2014are famous for\njob-hopping. Over half of working millennials have reported that they are\nusually open to new job opportunities. Not only are they less likely to remain\nat any one position indefinitely, but they are also more focused on the comprehensive\ndefinitions of an organization\u2019s culture. If corporations throughout the country\nwish to continue hiring new employees, they may have to take a harder look at\ntheir corporate culture. \u201cClearly, many young professionals are thinking about\nmore than money and are willing to sacrifice a portion of their salary in\nexchange for a career move that more closely aligns with their values or\npassions or improves their work-life balance,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/08\/fidelity-millennial-study-career\/\">Kristen\nRobinson<\/a>, senior vice president, Women &amp; Young Investors, Fidelity\nInvestments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While working millennials have previously been characterized\nas desperate hamster-wheel employees struggling to pay off student loan debt,\nrecent studies have shown that millennials are seeking a work-life balance that\nis supported by their employer. Work-life flexibility can come in many forms,\nsuch as flexible scheduling and remote working opportunities. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alankohll\/2018\/10\/03\/why-millennials-are-good-for-employee-well-being\/#672b7c301da5\">The\nSloan Center on Aging &amp; Work<\/a> reported \u201ca study of more than 19,000\nemployees showed that stress and burnout was lower among workers engaged in all\ntypes of flexibility arrangements.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we know about <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/08\/the-cycle-of-corporate-culture\/\">the\ncycle of corporate culture<\/a> indicates that these employees who are having\nmore positive work experiences through work-life balance are then pouring themselves\nback into their employment, furthering the health of the organization\u2019s culture.\nAccording to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/businessjournal\/190352\/managing-employee-risk-requires-culture-compliance.aspx\">Gallup<\/a>,\nteams with high employee engagement rates are 21% more productive and have 28%\nless internal theft than those with low engagement. When employees are engaged,\nthe wheels of the corporate machine turn fluidly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporations can begin the process of improving their corporate culture by soliciting an independent <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/09\/corporate-culture-audit-what-to-expect-during-an-audit\/\">corporate culture audit<\/a> from firms in the risk assessment and private investigation industry.
