Crimes concerning only the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinow.com\/articles\/2210\/the-utah-gumshoe-fraudulent-property-claims-5-red-flags\"> theft of personal property like jewelry, art, electronics, and other valuable items<\/a> are usually moved to the back burner. This leaves many individuals without recourse and without their valuable property, and leaves private investigators with an opportunity to provide clarity and solutions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful and prolific private investigators typically have <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2018\/06\/private-edge-private-investigators-probative-advantage\/\">a background in law enforcement<\/a>, working in law enforcement agencies, or in tandem with law enforcement. They develop a similar resume, and experience in forensic methodology, subject profiling, and making recommendations to clients regarding their case and how to move forward. They have a similar tool chest of instinct, rapport, and due-diligence that carries them from the intake call to the closing report. When law enforcement cannot pursue a non-violent crime for whatever reason, private investigators are ideal candidates to pick up the slack, and that includes  the theft of art, jewelry, or other valuable property. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, private investigators are completely independent,\nand do not rely on a chain of command. Their autonomy makes them an ideal\nprofessional to chase leads on stolen property. This means there is no valuable\ntime lost to bureaucracy and private investigators spend billable hours serving\ntheir clients. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Witness location is one of a private investigator\u2019s greatest\nskills when it comes to the theft of art, jewelry, or other valuable property.\nOne of the most difficult parts of any investigation is identifying the unseen\nhuman sources in any case. Private investigators can canvass the surrounding\nareas\u2014neighbors and businesses\u2014asking relevant questions about suspicious\nactivity or the regular faces in the neighborhood. Private investigators can\nalso canvass the pawn shops in the area in search of art and jewelry that was\npawned for a quick buck by the thief. Private investigators collect the witness\nstatements, contact information, and include it as part of a comprehensive\nclosing report. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private investigators are also proficient in identifying the non-human sources associated with art &amp; jewelry theft investigations. <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2018\/09\/tagged-geosocial-investigations-2018\/\">Due to the ubiquity of both internal and external CCTV footage<\/a>, it\u2019s more possible than ever for investigators to map a suspect\u2019s movements following a crime. Private investigators identify these surveillance systems and pull the footage for review to identifying human sources and potential suspects. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media is also a valuable asset in any investigation,\nbut particularly with regards to theft of valuable property. If the thief does\nnot pawn the item, they might try to sell it online, possibly through Facebook\nMarketplace, or on an auction website. Private investigators also know how to\ngather geo-social data as further evidence of the theft, and can use the\ninformation found to recover the stolen item. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private investigators are the ideal professionals to conduct an investigation into  the theft of art, jewelry, or other valuable property . Their independence and their objectivity allow them to follow any lead and turn over every rock. Their access to verified databases and use of proven methodology means they can find the thief in your midst, and help you recover your treasure. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even the most equipped and vigilant police department must prioritize casework\u2014a triage in which violent crimes are placed at the forefront daily operations and receive the most resources from jurisdictional law enforcement.
