At the time, they gave what you thought would have been a plausible explanation. \u2018My cell phone broke\u2019 or \u2018I had a flat tire on my car.\u2019 In retrospect, (that) excuse no longer holds water,\u201d Massa added.<\/p>\n<p>Other behaviors might now be considered suspicious. It is often a seemingly inconsequential detail someone calls in that can break a case wide open.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDid an individual travel unexpectedly?\u201d Massa said. \u201cDid they change their appearance? Did they shave their beard, cut their hair or change the color of their hair? Did they change the way they dress?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even behavioral changes occurring shortly after February 13, 2017:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone who developed a different sleep pattern<\/li>\n<li>Started abusing drugs or alcohol<\/li>\n<li>Has become anxious or irritable<\/li>\n<li>Someone who has followed this case to an extreme<\/li>\n<li>A person who has ongoing conversations about where they were February 13<sup>th<\/sup><\/li>\n<li>Someone who has visited the location where the girls were murdered<\/li>\n<li>Someone who has taken photographs around the trail and bridge<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Police say don\u2019t ever feel bad about reporting odd behavior. It could have everything to do with finding justice for two little girls brutally murdered. It could save other children from a similar and tragic outcome. In addition, if the person is innocent, it will only take a couple minutes of their time and they will never know you were the one who made the report.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A Person of Interest Dismissed<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office sent officers to Colorado to retrieve a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the murders of Abby and Libby.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1623 alignright lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Daniel-Nations-300x219.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Nations\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 300px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 300\/219;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Daniel Nations had been arrested in Colorado for threatening hikers with a hatchet on a Colorado trail.

Neither did they.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>They both loved music. Both played the Alto Saxophone in their middle school band. They loved photography and painting, and both were signed up to play softball.<\/p>\n<p>Life has changed for both families. Libby is remembered as the \u201cbaker\u201d of the family.

She could throw a batch of cookies together like no other.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Libby loved using sticky notes. She would leave sticky notes on her grandmother\u2019s car visor. One read, \u201cI love you!
