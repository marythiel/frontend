While many struggle during this time of social\nisolation, internal investigations in corporations and organizations are\nexperiencing major disruption as well. Corporate investigators can continue to\nexpect unique challenges with internal investigations, and will have to rely on\ntelecommunications in order to continue their due-diligence. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any seasoned investigator will tell you that one of the\ngreatest challenges with internal investigations is developing rapport with the\nhuman sources in the case. This is usually achieved by face-to-face\ninteraction, bringing down the witness\u2019 guard, and evaluating everything from\ntheir facial expressions to their body language. With everyone working from\nhome (or not at all), internal investigators have lost access to face-to-face contact\nwith those human sources and witnesses. Investigators have transitioned to\nconducting crucial interviews over the phone, which may not have as many\ndrawbacks as you think. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2020\/02\/19\/top-5-internal-corporate-issues-in-2020\/\">Internal investigations<\/a> can already by tricky without the benefit of seeing the other person&#8217;s face or actions. We\u2019re often told that a person\u2019s actions\u2014not their words\u2014are a good indicator of honest or dishonest accounts of any type of incident. Are they blinking too much, or not enough? Are they touching their face? Are they inexplicably breaking out in sweat or becoming flushed? These are all clues private investigators and corporate investigators consider when determining the veracity of a witness\u2019 story. But can you find the truth from only hearing a person\u2019s voice? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies indicate that human beings actually can tell a lot more from a person\u2019s voice than their body language when it comes to gauging their level of honesty. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.complianceweek.com\/investigations\/10-takeaways-from-science-of-workplace-investigations\/28597.article\">Michael Johnson, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney and CEO of Clear Law Institute<\/a>, stated \u201cWhile there are some non-verbal cues to lying, most people don\u2019t know what those are, and sometimes they are the opposite of what you think.\u201d Conducting corporate investigations over the phone doesn\u2019t mean investigators still can\u2019t garner helpful information. Without the distraction of visual stimuli, investigators are able to take detailed notes about a person\u2019s story\u2014the timeline, the verbiage, the tone. Investigators are able to detect inconsistencies in the witness\u2019 story and ask follow-up questions for further context that can benefit the investigation. An interview over the phone also removes any personal biases that an investigator can potentially develop from seeing someone in person with regards to their physical appearance, such as sex, race, and class. The investigator is forced to rely on the information, and is less vulnerable to deception on the part of the witness. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In uncertain times, it feels as though COVID-19 has brought\nthe entire world to a halt. That\u2019s why investigators must lean into one of\ntheir greatest skills, which is flexibility. Quarantine doesn\u2019t mean that\ninvestigators have to stop their investigations, but they must instead adapt\ntheir existing skillset to ensure that the wheels of progress will continue to\nturn\u2014even in crisis. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Corporate Investigations Move to Telecommunications During COVID-19 Outbreak COVID-19, or \u201cthe corona virus\u201d has already had an unprecedented effect on the world\u2019s economy in the 21st century.
