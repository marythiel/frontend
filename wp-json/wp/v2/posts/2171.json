That\u2019s why corporations across the\ncountry are electing to undergo <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/does-your-corporation-need-a-culture-audit\/\">corporate\nculture audits<\/a> in order to get a full picture of what the internal issues\nare so they can make concentrated efforts towards improving their business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No two <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/does-your-corporation-need-a-culture-audit\/\">culture\naudits<\/a> will ever be the same\u2014which is as it should be. Every company or\norganization is fundamentally different from one other, not only due to its structure\nand size, but because no workforce should be evaluated with the same measuring\nstick as another. It\u2019s imperative that the context of every single corporation\nbe fully explored. Full context can include, but is never limited to things\nlike corporate mission, vision, values, internal operations, structure, and\nleadership. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undergoing<a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/corporate-culture-audit\/\"> corporate culture audits<\/a> is the first real step in addressing pervasive issues within the workplace. Think of it as an annual physical or checkup with a physician for your business. When you go to the doctor, you undergo an examination, and the specialists run tests in order to determine how healthy you are\u2014a corporate culture audit is no different. A corporate culture auditor comes in and evaluates the level of functionality within your corporation so you can start implementing strategies to improve and grow your business. Here are some things that a corporate auditor might look at when they evaluate a corporation or organization: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Is everyone in the company invested in the same\nthings? <\/li><li>What are the valued differences between your\ncorporation and the competition? <\/li><li>What are the key measures of success within your\ncompany? <\/li><li>What is the functionality of the leadership in\nplace versus the leadership required for success? <\/li><li>What are the environmental factors that are\ncontributing to the decline in culture? <\/li><li>What is the history of your company\u2019s culture\nfrom its foundation? <\/li><li>What are the subcultures that have formed in\nyour organization and what is their role within the company? <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate culture audits usually begin by speaking to\nleadership. As the old adage goes, \u201cThe fish stinks from the head.\u201d Many\nproblems within an organization can be traced back to problems with leadership,\nand corporate culture auditors evaluate from the top down. Even if a CEO or\nmanager is engaged in supervision of daily operations, they may still be making\ndaily mistakes that contribute to stalls in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once leadership has been evaluated, auditors turn their\nattention to internal operations. This involves looking at the chain of\ncommand, the productivity flow (how the integral processes move from employee\nto employee), and the quality of communication throughout the company. This\nmight involve interviewing department heads, reviewing meeting minutes, and\nevaluating the environment of the workplace. This step is crucial, because regardless\nof the leadership or employees in place, if the ecosystem of the workplace is\nflawed, it can be difficult for even the most efficient, engaged employee to achieve\nsuccess. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evaluating the environment and internal operations is\ntantamount to establishing a bulletproof process for success\u2014leaving the\nworkforce as one of the final pillars to be examined by the auditor. When you\nseek a comprehensive picture of your employees\u2019 level of engagement, it\u2019s\nimportant for auditors to identify the subcultures that are either contributing\nor derailing your company\u2019s mission and values. For example\u2014there might be a\ncluster of apathetic employees, who are not only disengaging together, but their\nbehavior actively encourages other employees to exhibit the same habits. This kind\nof apathy can be a cancer in your corporation and may spread to other parts of\nyour workforce, further contributing to the decline of business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, at the conclusion of the audit, an\ninvestigator will prepare a detailed report with very explicit recommendations\nfor how to fix the problems within the corporation or organization. This could\ninclude items such as the termination of toxic employees, the revitalization of\ninternal operations, and necessary changes to a brick and mortar locations for\nincreased security or higher accountability. Once the audit is complete, the\nburden of change lies with leadership to become beacons of change within the\ninternal structure. Corporate culture begins to improve when leadership\nenforces changes from the top, allowing their example to trickle down through\nthe organization in the form of higher accountability and increased engagement.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your corporation is suffering from a corporate crisis, don\u2019t hesitate. Corporate culture audits are pulling more and more companies back into the black every day.
