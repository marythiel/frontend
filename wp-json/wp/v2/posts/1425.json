Gaining factual, legally viable evidence of an affair, he says, is not only necessary, but it can give a woman an advantage.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why hiring a professional private investigator to do the job is a good idea,\u201d says Paoletti.<\/p>\n<p>For the wife\u2019s part, Paoletti suggests that she leave the evidence gathering to the professionals and keep a journal of any suspicious activity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWomen seem to have a sixth sense about infidelity, so once a wife begins to suspect, they should start writing down those suspicions,\u201d says Paoletti. \u201cWe tell our clients to give as much detail as possible about why they suspect that an affair is taking place and take notes that include any strange behavior with times, dates and observations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Paoletti suggests that the wife makes sure to keep the journal hidden by asking a friend to hold onto the journal for her.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe longer that a woman is able to keep her suspicions a secret, the longer she will be able to garner evidence,\u201d says Paoletti. \u201cLetting the spouse know of any suspicions may cause him to change his routine, which makes gathering evidence harder. Of course, it is advisable to involve a professional private investigator as soon as possible, to be sure that all bases are covered.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Established in 2001, Infidelity Investigations is a bonded, fully insured and licensed private investigation firm in the State of Connecticut, specializing in infidelity investigations, surveillance, background investigations, attorney investigation services, and GPS tracking.
