They\u2019re betting on someone whom they\u2019ve only met in person maybe three times.\u00a0Not every candidate can be a winner, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should accept the losers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Every business takes on some level of risk when they bring on a new-hire, but how serious is employee theft? The 2015 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.d-ddaily.com\/images\/10-06-15_US_Fraud_Survey.pdf\">US Retail Fraud Survey<\/a> says, \u201cOverall the biggest area of store loss remains employee theft with 38% of respondents citing it as the number one area of store loss and, across first, second and third highest causes of loss, scoring 59 points.\u201d Here are some ways Human Resources can better vet employees and prevent future theft.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Ask tough questions throughout the interview process<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Interviewing job candidates is the best chance you&#8217;ll get to learn who they are before hiring them. Take advantage of these opportunities to ask candidates tough questions about their past. This may seem like an obvious tip, but it\u2019s one many people can find difficult to execute.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">People can be surprisingly candid about things they\u2019ve done in the past and may be more open than one would expect. In these moments of truth human resources is given the opportunity to evaluate the honesty of the candidate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Follow-up with multiple references<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">There\u2019s a reason every business asks for multiple references when considering candidates for a position. After you\u2019ve interview a candidate face-to-face you&#8217;ll have a better idea of who they are and what questions you still have about them. Following up with a candidate\u2019s references can be very illuminating.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Calling just one or two of the references should not be seen as enough. Every candidate should supply at least three references to be considered for employment. These should be professional references, not friends or family. Call at least three references when considering any candidate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Use a Private Investigations firm to help<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Human Resources departments only have so much manpower they can put towards vetting employees. With all of the duties HR handles it increases the chances that someone will slip through the cracks and get hired when they shouldn\u2019t have.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">You might not need them for every candidate, but Private Investigation firms can help any business be certain about the people they\u2019re hiring. When businesses are expanding they may need to hire people rapidly. Instead of asking HR to do more with less, contact a private investigations firm and see how they can help shoulder the load.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Human Resources has a tough job when it comes to screening future employees.
