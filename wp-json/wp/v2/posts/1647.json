In the span of 72 hours, Muto wrote a series of articles detailing the internal workings of the network, along with stealing and selling raw video clips. In 2013, he pled guilty to two misdemeanor charges and was dubbed the \u201cFox Mole.\u201d He was fined $1000 and sentenced to over 200 hours community service. At sentencing, he said he wished he had never betrayed his former employer.<\/p>\n<p>United States industries spend more on research and development of unique products and processes than any other country in the world.

Mr. Moore is both unappreciated and unhappy with his career as an engineer at a glass insulation and fire-retardant firm.

The FBI states company moles are often \u201coverwhelmed by life-crisis or career disappointment\u201d driving them to leak information.<\/p>\n<p>With email, cell phones, and jump drives, stealing information is far easier than in the past. Greed and financial need, unhappiness at work, the promise of a better job, drug or alcohol abuse, and\/or vulnerability to blackmail, can all be contributors, says the FBI.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1650 alignleft lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/listener-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"listener\" width=\"316\" height=\"158\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 316px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 316\/158;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The FBI says employees who leak trade secrets, such as plans, customer databases, etc. will exhibit behaviors other employees can often identify to help prevent breaches.<\/p>\n<p>Your employees may be the first line of protection when combatting the insider threat.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Potential Indicators:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drastic changes in behavior, demeanor, or work habits.<\/li>\n<li>Unexplained affluence.<\/li>\n<li>Financial hardship.<\/li>\n<li>Substance abuse.<\/li>\n<li>Attempts to circumvent security procedures.<\/li>\n<li>Long hours at the office without authorization.<\/li>\n<li>Taking home proprietary information.<\/li>\n<li>Unnecessarily copying materials.<\/li>\n<li>Using an unauthorized USB drive.<\/li>\n<li>Unusual use of cell phone during business hours.<\/li>\n<li>Asking inappropriate questions.<\/li>\n<li>Suspicious relationships with competitors.<\/li>\n<li>Leaving traps to detect searches of their office.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Based on FBI\u2019s studies, additionally, there are more subtle things to look for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone hired to steal company information will be experienced in the operation of a business and will be able to identify the value of your company\u2019s trade secrets.<\/li>\n<li>Corporate spies are everyone\u2019s friend. To gain access to a company in order to steal information, a mole will be socially adept with the ability to manipulate people to gain their trust.<\/li>\n<li>Individuals who are frequently wandering or talking in locations they do not need to be to complete their job. Someone who reflects a pattern will always have a reasonable excuse as to why they are not in the correct area or talking to specific employees.<\/li>\n<li>Employees who keep trying to re-open decisions already settled and question advisability of decisions.<\/li>\n<li>They act envious.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Vulnerabilities \u2013 Getting Access<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once inside, a mole has a lot of ways to access sensitive information. Spies can even work in pairs, possibly one as a consultant and the other an employee. When you have valuable information, never underestimate the methods others will use to gain access to it.<\/p>\n<p>Spying can be as easy as photocopying papers found on unattended desks or at printers. Walking into an empty meeting room with a laptop and pulling data off the network.<\/p>\n<p>A common ploy is pretending to be an employee. Another ploy often used, posing as IT personnel because it enables the individual to look legitimate while accessing network access points and sitting at someone\u2019s computer. In other cases, spies have posed as cleaning staff, gaining access after-hours.<\/p>\n<p>Criminals capitalize on the common assumption if you are in the building, you must be okay. Investing in your company\u2019s staff to raise awareness is the best investment a company can make.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.infoworld.com\/article\/2650884\/security\/how-to-spot----and-stop----a-corporate-spy.html\">InfoWorld<\/a>, Peter Wood, Chief of Operations at First Base Technologies, a U.K. based consultant firm performing ethical hacking services, \u201cSpies are interested in anything from financial data to intellectual property and customer data. They might steal information for blackmail purposes, but the most common motive for physical intrusion is industrial espionage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wood says the most common way to intrude upon a company is posing as an employee or a visitor, even creating convincing costumes to pose as a legitimate visitor such as telephone, electrical or maintenance person, a burglar alarm inspector, even someone from the fire department.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Protecting Your Trade Secrets<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The FBI lists several ways to protect your workplace from insider threats.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recognize the threat.<\/li>\n<li>Identify and value trade secrets.<\/li>\n<li>Implement a definable plan for safeguarding trade secrets.<\/li>\n<li>Secure physical trade secrets and limit access to trade secrets.<\/li>\n<li>Provide ongoing security training to employees.<\/li>\n<li>Use protective tools such as screensavers with password controls.<\/li>\n<li>Classify information and store accordingly.<\/li>\n<li>Secure the workplace so visitors do not have access without security screening.<\/li>\n<li>Encrypt data and require strong passwords for employees with liberal access rights.<\/li>\n<li>Develop an insider threat program.<\/li>\n<li>Proactively report suspicious incidents to the FBI before your proprietary information is irreversibly compromised.<\/li>\n<li>Ask the FBI or other security professionals for additional awareness training.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At times, companies are hesitant to report such activity for fear they will risk their trade secrets being disclosed in court or compromised in any way.
