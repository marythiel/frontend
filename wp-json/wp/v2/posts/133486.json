Pervasive internal or external problems in a corporation can run an otherwise solid operation into the ground. Problems between employees, theft of trade secrets, and public relations incidents are just some of the issues that can hamper a company for decades to come. That\u2019s why knowing what qualities to look for when hiring a corporate intelligence firm is key.&nbsp; Not all corporate intelligence firms are created equal and if leadership is not careful, they could just be throwing money down a hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Experience<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When hiring a corporate intelligence firm, it\u2019s important to remember that while the company itself should run like a well-oiled machine, it\u2019s the quality of the investigators that are the most important. Corporate investigators are tasked with evidence gathering, interviewing witnesses, and deductive reasoning that could make or break your company. While the corporate intelligence firm may specialize in certain types of investigations, the available investigators may not have the background required to meet your needs. Corporate investigation firms typically hire someone with former investigation with law enforcement, often federal law enforcement. While there are highly qualified corporate investigators with no experience working for federal law enforcement, it is up to the client to exercise due-diligence and ask the right questions. When hiring a corporate intelligence firm, no consultant should ever be hesitant about answering questions regarding their history of civil service, or the specific qualifications of the individual investigator or team of investigators who will be addressing the company\u2019s corporate intelligence needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When hiring a corporate intelligence firm, the client should never be afraid to get specific with the firm regarding questions about how they plan to meet their specific investigation needs. While many corporations experience similar disruptions to their daily operations\u2014just like the firms themselves\u2014not all investigation types are created equal. An internal employee theft investigation is much different from a sexual harassment investigation, and the right investigator with the right experience could be the difference between getting answers and getting jerked around. Otherwise important details might be missed and the problem continues unsolved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Field investigations in which data is aggregated by the investigator is important, but it\u2019s also imperative that companies hire a corporate intelligence firm that has the capabilities to gather data by means of examining and auditing company databases and searching verified background databases in order to develop leads in the investigation. These corporate intelligence firms should be literate in the IT systems your company utilizes and should be able to connect to them efficiently. This means the investigator will be able to follow any leads that develop in pursuit of answers. Most importantly, the firm should be able to use this information under the most rigid of confidentiality agreements. Otherwise, the firm could open your company up to further internal or external threats, thereby exacerbating the existing issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Preservation of Attorney-Client Privilege<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporations can help improve their chances of maintaining confidentiality by having an in-house attorney to oversee the contracting of these investigators. When an investigator of any kind is contracted by in-house counsel, they can maintain confidentiality has the investigator does the fact-finding on the company\u2019s behalf. Without these necessary steps, facts uncovered during the investigation can place the company in further jeopardy and be subject to other forms of investigation that might occur during any subsequent legal action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your company is in the process of hiring a corporate intelligence firm, please consider Lauth Investigations International for your corporate investigation needs.
