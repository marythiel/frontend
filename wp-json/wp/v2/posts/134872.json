Employees can feel confident that they will be fully supported if they need a corporate investigator in their corner, and the company itself can deftly tread paths that might otherwise be legally perilous.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That all sounds great\u2014certainly\u2014but where should a business turn to when aiming to establish those best practices in the first place? Today, we&#8217;re going to dive into the vital considerations when building a workplace investigations strategy that will serve you well today and in the years to come. Read on, and wrap your mind around all the major need-to-knows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Vital Nature of Neutrality<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether seeking simply to consult on internal investigations or aiming to place a delicate matter in the hands of a seasoned corporate investigator, the importance of neutrality can&#8217;t be overstated. If choosing who will lead an internal investigation or contacting someone from central HR within your company for advice, it is critical to assess whether their contribution can be truly viewed as impartial.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are personal connections to those being investigated, witnesses, or victims in the case of <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/harassment-discrimination\/\">workplace harassment or discrimination<\/a>, this may become a lead weight around the neck of the investigation if it ever leads to litigation. Neutral oversight is essential of the investigation is to be considered airtight, so if in doubt, reach out to an external <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/corporate-investigations\/\">corporate investigations specialist<\/a> for necessary support as a legal safeguard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Seeking Out the Right Skillset<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A misstep in internal investigations can leave a company open to accusations of retaliation and the potential of an unfair dismissal lawsuit. This means that advice taken when planning your investigatory tactics should come from those truly in the know, and crucially, be rooted in more than mere opinion. An appropriate consulting advisor or corporate investigator will be able to fully grasp workplace policies and frame them within the context of applicable laws and legal obligations. Don&#8217;t forget that they may also require the skills to audit financials conduct computer forensics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Availability to Take Action<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launching internal investigations without someone at the helm who can handle the complexity and sensitivity of the complaint at hand is a dangerous move, but so too is waiting for a senior HR professional to have time in their schedule to take on the task. Delays in launching internal investigations can lead to leaks to the press and even occupational health and safety complaints. When a matter is serious in nature, bringing in a corporate investigator who can take action immediately is the only logical choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Prioritizing Appropriate Seniority<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a workplace complaint is made against a senior individual within the team, the prospect of impartial internal investigations becomes slim at best. It is a a simple reality that it&#8217;s highly unlikely someone unconnected to that individual, with no vested interest in the outcome, and within a position that is superior to those under investigation can be called upon. In contrast, an external corporate investigator will be unaffected by the high rank of the parties under investigation and will be able to lend neutral authority to the conclusions drawn.<br><br>Do you need expert guidance for workplace investigations or a corporate investigator ready to jump on the task at hand?
