Many corporations and organizations have at least one employee who exhibits all the major signs of checking out in their daily capacity.  Even if your corporation has bulletproofed human resource operations, employee burnout can still occur. That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative for leadership and management to know and identify the signs of apathy on the part of an employee. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Signs of Employee Apathy <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A repeated pattern of tardiness <\/li><li>Poor appearance and hygiene <\/li><li>Complaints about lack of money and\/or repeated\nattempts to borrow money <\/li><li>Exclusive precedence on their personal life <\/li><li>An excess of breaks <\/li><li>Appearance of being busy with nothing to show\nfor it<\/li><li>Lack of accountability, making excuses <\/li><li>Irrelevant preoccupation with cell phones, smart\ndevices <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It stands to reason that if an employee is underperforming\nat their job, leadership will cut the dead weight for the good of a\ncorporation. There are actually three umbrella categories that are often used\nto justify retaining apathetic employees: Costs, Litigation, and Personal. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Costs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing leadership will think of when they notice\nan apathetic employee is dollar signs. Not only is the apathetic employee hemorrhaging\ntheir money by wasting time and resources, but the cost to replace that\napathetic employee can also be an issue. Costs are incurred to the human\nresources department to find, hire, and train a replacement. Employers might\nhesitate to fire an apathetic employee because of unemployment insurance rates.\nAnother relevant factor specifically effects small businesses, in which the\nworkforce is not large enough to support turnover operations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personal <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it\u2019s not a matter of money, it can often be a matter\nof personal feelings or relationships concerning leadership and the apathetic\nemployee. A manager or owner might have a personal relationship with the\nemployee, and their bias prevents them from pulling the trigger on termination\nprocedures. Personal knowledge of that employee\u2019s personal life and their\nidentity as a person (rather than an employee) can color their perceptions and\nincrease their latitude with the employee. Avoidance behavior can also play a\nrole. When this happens, leadership usually resigns itself to one of two end results:\nEither the employee will improve on their own without intervention from\nleadership, or they will leave on their own without termination proceedings. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Litigation <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The independent judgement of leadership may not be the\nsticking point in terminating an apathetic employee. There are often legal factors\nthat a corporation or organization must consider. For instance, the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (AEDA) protects employees from being\nterminated based on their age. If an apathetic employee is of a certain age,\nleadership may fear legal retaliation, citing age discrimination as the reason\nfor their termination. In higher education, an employee may have tenure as defined\nby the institution, which would prevent leadership from terminating them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Risks in Retention <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retaining apathetic employees for any of the reasons\nlisted above can have serious consequences for a company who is avoiding the\nissue or trying to save money. Apathetic\/underperforming employees cannot\nprovide a customer base with quality service, leading to dissatisfaction and\nconsumer complaints. This can negatively impact the corporation\u2019s brand or\ncampaign, with a high risk of human error, loss of valued customers, and lost\nreputation. Disgruntled employees could potentially say negative things about the\ncorporation on their social media accounts. Perhaps most concerning, apathetic\nemployees can easily spread their attitude throughout a work force, and harm long-term\ngoals for the corporation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corporate Culture Audits <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One apathetic employee is enough of a drain on company time and resources, but if that attitude is contagious, you could have a larger problem on your hands. Unfortunately, when it comes to employee morale and performance, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why so many corporations and organizations are investing in quarterly or even biannual <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/does-your-corporation-need-a-culture-audit\/\">corporate culture audits<\/a>. With a corporate culture audit, an independent, third party firm, like a private investigator or security company, conducts a full overview of company operations, structure, and environment in order to identify problems at their source for the health of the corporation. With a corporate culture audit, leadership will be able to identify factors that might be contributing to employee apathy. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to tell if your employees have checked out&#8230; Employee apathy may seem innocuous enough, but the costs to time and resources can be a slow, devastating drain on a corporation.
