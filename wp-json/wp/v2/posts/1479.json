From rude transactions to mismanaged orders, it seems that no one is having a good experience with your company. Yet, every time you go to the location, the staff seems helpful, friendly and organized. What can you do to find out the real problem?<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not a made up scenario. Business owners around the country are often baffled by customer service complaints that are directed as some of their most trusted employees. Although there seems to be some miscommunication, there could actually be a deeper problem &#8211; one that requires some investigation to uncover.<\/p>\n<p>But, if you ignore it, it could just ruin your business.<\/p>\n<h3>The Importance of 21st Century Customer Service<\/h3>\n<p>Customer service is one the most important parts of keeping a business running, especially in our current Age of Information. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.helpscout.net\/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research shows<\/a> that up to 78% of customers will stop from purchasing at your business because of a poor customer service experience. And, over 1 million people share their customer service experiences on social media each week, with over 80% of them being negative.<\/p>\n<p>That means, you can&#8217;t afford to have a bad customer service reputation. It is likely to be instantly tweeted, texted, and posted, which could cause huge problems for your business in the long run.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_795\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/556796143_d377b8011a_z.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-795\" class=\"size-full wp-image-795 lazyload\" alt=\"Photo via BrewBooks\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/556796143_d377b8011a_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 640px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 640\/480;\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/brewbooks\/556796143\/in\/photolist-RcJ6v-92fsFk-p7xVZN-8MCvgt-aRsUYB-9fdhHh-ofs3XW-6FaL1-6FaJ1-6FaGg-6FaE4-6FaCf-ehALMS-79Je7-5vBma2-ehALKf-DV6Pc-2teJxv-e1x9DZ-8JUb5L-65uLdG-81G2nb-81G4Hh-81CUYP-81G473-81CUrB-81CU7K-81G3df-81CTza-81CTj4-81CPeK-81G6Gb-gyBL9f-81CSJK-81G1Lf-81G1tA-81CRNK-81FZUA-81FZAG-81FZhW-81FZ1w-81CQjD-81CQ34-81FYc1-81FXVJ-81FXnN-81FX6h-81CNki-81CWWp-81CWBx\">BrewBooks<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>But, how can you solve a problem that you can&#8217;t see? That&#8217;s where a private investigator comes in handy.<\/p>\n<h3>How a Private Investigator Can Help<\/h3>\n<p>Fortunately, there is a way to get to the bottom of your customer service problems quickly and efficiently. By hiring a private investigator like the professionals at Lauth Investigations, you can get a first-hand look at what your customers experience on a daily basis. There are a few reasons why a private investigator is the perfect solution to your customer service problems:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal;\">Anonymous<\/strong> &#8211; Your staff won&#8217;t treat a private investigator any differently than any other customer. Why? Because they won&#8217;t know who it is.<\/li>\n<li><strong style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal;\">Experienced<\/strong> &#8211; Private investigators like the professionals at Lauth Investigations are used to dealing with criminals. If there is something shady going on that is fueling the problem, they&#8217;ll be able to detect it and suggest further investigation.<\/li>\n<li><strong style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal;\">Thorough<\/strong> &#8211; Not only does a private investigator shop at your location, they take note. How does the facility look? What are employees spending their time doing? Is there inappropriate behavior that is harming your professional reputation?<\/li>\n<li><strong style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal;\">Follow-Up Plan<\/strong> &#8211; In the event that the private investigator finds behavior that is criminal in nature, they will create a follow-up plan to gain more information through records, surveillance tapes, and other recording devices. This can be helpful if the case goes to litigation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can&#8217;t afford to have your business brought down by a few bad eggs. Hiring a private investigator helps you find the issues that can be improved in your company, and just might save your business in the long-run.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture this: You are constantly getting bombarded with complaints from your customers about the service at a single location.
