The virtual aspect of the scam involves staging a scene on the phone to convince a person that a loved one has been kidnapped, following with a demand for ransom.<\/p>\n<p>According to the FBI, \u201cThe success of any type of virtual kidnapping scheme depends on speed and fear. Criminals know they only have a short time to exact a ransom before victims unravel the scam or authorities become involved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Typically, the scam is executed by calling a victim claiming they have kidnapped a loved one, then demand a ransom in exchange for the loved one\u2019s safe return.<\/p>\n<p>Valerie Sobel is one such person who did receive a call from a person who said, \u201cWe have your daughter\u2019s finger. Pay up or you\u2019ll get the rest of her body in a body bag.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Petrified, Sobel rushed to a money transfer location to pay the ransom, wiring $4,000 to the person who claimed to have kidnapped her daughter.<\/p>\n<p>Valerie made many frantic phone calls to her daughter\u2019s cell phone and after many hours had passed, her daughter Simone called her back totally confused but safe.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, scammers call random numbers hoping to find a person who they can convince, while other times these scammers research Facebook and other social media platforms for names and numbers. If a scammer calls 100 people, chances are at least one will instantly pay.<\/p>\n<p>Another way it may go down is a scammer calls you and you hear a child crying, \u201cMom, please help me.\u201d Panic immediately sets in. You think it is your child. Then a man\u2019s voice comes on the phone and calls you by your first name. This legitimizes the caller and you immediately ask them to just tell you what they want. What mother would not empty her bank account in exchange for her child\u2019s safety.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t think you could become a victim, please read on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1977 lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/ched-1024x724.png\" alt=\"ched\" width=\"1024\" height=\"724\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/724;\" \/><strong>Virtually Kidnapped Daughter<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to the Washington Post, Wendy Mueller lives in historic Leesburg, Va., and never thought she would become a victim of a virtual kidnapping scam.<\/p>\n<p>One afternoon, while standing at her kitchen sink, she received a call from a number she did not recognize but answered.<\/p>\n<p>She heard screaming and it sounded like her 23-year old daughter\u2019s voice begging for help.<\/p>\n<p>Then a man\u2019s voice tells her, \u201cwe have your daughter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The caller told Mueller to put her phone on speaker, get her purse and phone charger and get into the car.<\/p>\n<p>The man asked, \u201cHow much cash can you get right now?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>$10,000,\u201d Mueller replied.<\/p>\n<p>The man told her not to contact anyone for help or they would kill her daughter.<\/p>\n<p>Mueller\u2019s daughter attends college hundreds of miles away and she had no way of knowing her daughter was safe.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey told me they were actually targeting someone else, someone they would be able to get a lot of money for. But they said my daughter intervened when they tried to grab him. And that sounded exactly like something she would do,\u201d Mueller said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was terrified,\u201d Mueller continued. \u201cThey told me they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The caller had told Mueller he had hacked her phone and knew every move she was making. For hours, he told her to go to small stores and offices across Northern Virginia, where she wired the max amount of usually $1,900 each time to names and addresses in Mexico that the caller had given Mueller.<\/p>\n<p>Mueller cross-crossed the state following his directions and making payments, until nightfall came.<\/p>\n<p>Mueller had kept asking to speak to her daughter.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey kept promising me: \u2018As soon as you send the last one, you will talk to her,\u2019\u201d Mueller said.<\/p>\n<p>The caller told Mueller he was a professional and part of a group of kidnappers \u2013 a huge organization \u2013 who do this all the time and kill.<\/p>\n<p>The man told Mueller they had placed a set of headphones on her daughter so she could hear everything, so her daughter would know if her mother did anything to cause her death.<\/p>\n<p>Mueller thought of stopping passersby but didn\u2019t want to chance the kidnapper knowing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was torture,\u201d Mueller said.<\/p>\n<p>As it turned out, her daughter was in class, safe and sound. Mueller had been scammed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>No one is immune<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thousands of families throughout the country have become targets of these malicious scammers.<\/p>\n<p>According to FBI kidnapping expert, Agent Eric Arbuthnot, several organizations use these scams regularly to make money.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThousands of dollars in ransom,\u201d said Arbuthnot. \u201cAnd you\u2019re talking about a criminal organization that is capable of doing more than one kidnapping at a time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Arbuthnot many of the cases have been happening on the West coast and along the border involving criminal organizations from Mexico, some claiming to be members of the cartel.<\/p>\n<p>The FBI has seen recent increases in California, Nevada, New York, and Texas and increasing on the east coast.<\/p>\n<p>Monroe Police Department in Connecticut said by using social media, scammers can identify a victim, look up relatives, and reference names of family members and friends to make the call appear legitimate.<\/p>\n<p>FBI Supervisory Agent Christopher Johnson said his office in St. Louis, Missouri, deals with these types of crimes. \u201cScammers will often mention specific facts about the parent or victim, likely from information they were able to obtain online.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Authorities say about one in five kidnapping cases are successful resulting in the criminal getting their ransom and not getting caught. While extortion has been around for decades, virtual ransom kidnapping calls are increasing around the country.<\/p>\n<p>With this emerging scam, the FBI has launched a nationwide campaign to warn parents to fight back against \u201cvirtual kidnapping.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1978 lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/guy-1024x573.png\" alt=\"guy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1024px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1024\/573;\" \/><strong>If you receive a virtual kidnapping ransom call<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Unlike traditional kidnapping schemes, a \u201cvirtual kidnapper\u201d has not actually kidnapped anyone.
