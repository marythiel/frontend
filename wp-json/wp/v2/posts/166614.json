The jury&#8217;s verdict \u2014 the largest ever obtained by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in the Northern District of Texas \u2014 underscores the critical importance of maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The airline employee \u2014 Sarah Budd \u2014 endured crude sexual comments from multiple coworkers and at least one manager, including lude suggestions that she engage in prostitution and perform demeaning sex acts. According to the EEOC, additional disturbing jokes about women who report sexual assault were commonplace. Despite Budd&#8217;s reports to her supervisor and the employee relations department, SkyWest&#8217;s investigations were insufficient, leading to lackluster disciplinary actions and canceled training sessions intended to address the harassment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case doubles down on the severe consequences organizations face when they fail to address workplace harassment effectively. Beyond legal repercussions, such negligence can lead to reputational damage and a decline in employee morale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Lauth Investigations Can Assist<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Lauth Investigations, we specialize in helping organizations prevent and address issues like those experienced by SkyWest Airlines.
