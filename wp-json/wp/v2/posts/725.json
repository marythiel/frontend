Why? There&#8217;s no more dramatic way to say &#8220;You&#8217;ve been cheating,&#8221; than on V-Day.<\/p>\n<p>In a recent interview with CBS Dallas-Forth Worth, professional private investigator Mike Duncan from Alliance Investigations, LLC explained that Valentine&#8217;s Day is a time of year when more people are susceptible to thinking that their spouse has been cheating.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a full-service firm [in the North Texas area], and we handle a lot of other types of cases,&#8221; Duncan said. &#8220;But, we really see an increase in [infidelity] cases this time of year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What is the cause of this increased infidelity investigation around the hallowed love holiday? Because this is the time that most cheaters are going to make a mistake that will get them caught.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>What Makes V-Day the Worst Day for Cheating?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nValentine&#8217;s is one of the most lucrative holidays in the world, bringing in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/business\/valentines-day-numbers-behindflower-trade_1301405.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated<\/a> $2.1 billion each year. Because of the social pressure to purchase gifts for romantic interests, private investigators spend many weeks leading up to (and following) V-day searching through credit card bills, checking cell phone interactions, and considering large withdrawals from bank accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, professional private investigators like Lauth Investigations International and Alliance Investigations have highlighted a few warning signs to look for before you call a private investigator to get involved in a potential love fiasco.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>5 Warning Signs That Your Spouse is Cheating This Valentine&#8217;s Day<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n1. Strange Cell Phone Usage: If your spouse suddenly starts locking his or her phone or laying it face down when you&#8217;re around, there is probably something on there they don&#8217;t want you to see. Also, if they start hiding it, there&#8217;s a good chance that you won&#8217;t be happy with what you find when you do find it.<\/p>\n<p>2. Missing Time Before or After V-Day: No cheater in his or her right mind would try to sneak away on Valentine&#8217;s Day. But, it is very likely that they will take out their lover the day before or after. This has become such an event that February 13th has been unofficially named, &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/life-style\/feb-13-mistress-day-marks-day-straying-men-article-1.290548\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mistress Day<\/a>.&#8221; Look for work excursions or day-long events during this time.<\/p>\n<p>3. Empty Browser History: Internet and social media usage has been shown to be directly correlated with cheating behavior, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewinternet.org\/2013\/10\/21\/online-dating-relationships\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pew Research<\/a>. Their study found that 24% of internet users have used online sites to flirt with others &#8211; despite marital status. This has given way to sites like AshleyMadison.com, which is designed to help married people cheat. If you find that you have a spouse who is consistently deleting browser history on a desktop or cell phone, he or she may be engaging in online activities they don&#8217;t want you to know about.<\/p>\n<p>4. Secret Social Media Accounts: Although this may be a hard one to catch, a secret social media account is one of the biggest warning signs of cheating in the 21st Century. In a study published in <a href=\"http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/cyber.2013.0570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking<\/a>, researcher Russell Clayton stated that,\u00a0&#8220;Greater active Twitter use led to greater negative conflicts and outcomes.&#8221; In addition, social mediums like Snapchat are designed to automatically delete conversations, giving cheaters more security in their online infidelity. Finding suspicious social media accounts under different names is a real sign that this may be happening in your home.<\/p>\n<p>5. Emotional Distance: Finally, although it is a nebulous concept, cheating always leads to a level of emotional distance followed by moments of intense response. Often, cheaters will want to emotionally distance themselves before committing adultery, then be emotionally recharged after a session of infidelity.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nAccording to some professionals, chances of infidelity may be as much as\u00a0<strong>25 percent <\/strong>over the lifetime of a marriage. Don&#8217;t wait another Valentine&#8217;s Day to find out if your suspicions are true. Contact a private investigation firm like Lauth Investigations if your spouse is giving off the red flags of infidelity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Although private investigators (PIs) are always pretty busy, Valentine&#8217;s Day is one of the most taxing parts of the whole year.
