Employee theft can come in all shapes\nand sizes, from an administrative assistant pocketing some extra Post-Its to\nhardcore embezzlement on behalf of leadership. It can be easy to dismiss\nrepeated instances of employee theft as isolated incidents, implementing\ndisciplinary action or termination, and moving on with the work week. However,\nmany executives and managers may not realize that repeated instances of employee\ntheft could be indicative of a much larger problem in their corporation or\norganization. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a position of leadership, it\u2019s easy to dismiss a single instance of employee theft; the employee is the one who made a choice to steal from their company or organization, and <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2018\/10\/investigating-employee-misconduct\/\">that employee was wrong for doing so<\/a>. Discipline or termination typically follows, and leadership walks away feeling confident that they\u2019ve removed a bad apple from their barrel. However, pervasive issues with employee theft are symptomatic of a systematic problem within the business or organization that go beyond a single employee\u2019s bad judgement. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why do employees steal? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three most common reasons employees steal are not very\ndifficult to understand. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>employees feel as though their employer has wronged them, or their compensation is inadequate.<\/li><li>employees believe that employers insure such losses\u2014therefore it is a victimless crime.<\/li><li>employees know they will not be held accountable if they are caught<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these reasons may characterize the employee as \u201cdisgruntled,\u201d a term with a cultural context that often absolves the employer of any misconduct. When a corporation or organization has repeated instances of multiple employees committing theft, it\u2019s a sign that the corporate culture of the workplace is less than healthy. A single employee pilfering staplers is not symptomatic of unhealthy corporate culture, but 5 employees pilfering staplers is a sign that employees do not feel valued, and therefore <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/8-signs-of-employee-apathy\/\">do not respect their employer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/08\/the-cycle-of-corporate-culture\/\">The cycle of healthy corporate culture<\/a> always begins with happy employees, because when employees are happy, they are more engaged, and contribute positively to the productivity of the organization. This pleases leadership, which incentivizes them to make decisions that raise morale, such as rewarding success with pay-raises, benefits, and thoughtful, constructive collaboration. The cycle begins anew with happy employees. Poor corporate culture means that undervalued employees will contribute negatively to workplace productivity. One of the ways poor corporate culture manifests is through employee theft\u2014and it\u2019s not just about profits or staplers. When employees are disengaged from their duties, they\u2019re more likely to take extraneous breaks, or taking longer breaks than permitted, which is theft of company time. This often comes from a rationalized perspective, in which the employee does not feel their own time is valued within the organization, and therefore will place the same perceived value on company time. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the type of theft, repeated instances of employee theft cannot be ignored. It may be a sign that your business or organization needs a corporate culture audit. <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/does-your-corporation-need-a-culture-audit\/\">A corporate culture audit is like a check-up<\/a>\u2014when you go into the doctor for a standard check-up, they evaluate all of your major bodily functions for signs of disease or deterioration, and a corporate culture audit is no different. When investigators conduct a corporate culture audit, they evaluate all of your business\u2019s internal operations, hiring processes, and principle employees for roadblocks that hinder productivity and contribute to poor corporate culture. The identification of these pervasive issues will lead to investigators providing leadership with expert recommendations to dislodge the blockage, allowing the cycle of corporate culture to right itself through cause and effect. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think your business or organization needs a corporate culture audit, call Lauth Investigations International today for a free quote on our <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/does-your-corporation-need-a-culture-audit\/\">Corporate Culture Audit program<\/a>.
