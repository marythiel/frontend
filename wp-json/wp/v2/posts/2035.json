Smollett has come under fire in the media and on the internet for his allegedly false account of a racially-motivated attack against him in January, where he alleged two men attempted to strangle him and pour bleach on him. When the story first broke, it was shaping up to be a watershed moment in conversations about how the current administration is affecting race-relations throughout the country. After law enforcement conducted an investigation into his version of events, they\u2019ve released statements that Smollett may have hired the men responsible to help him stage the attack. The case has created divisive new conversations about the United States\u2019 current political climate, but is also prompting career investigators to highlight the importance of thorough and diligent fact-finding in the early stages of any investigation\u2014especially within corporations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conducting an investigation with unimpeachable integrity is very similar to building a structure ready to withstand natural disasters. Laying a firm groundwork from the moment of the intake narrative will set an impregnable foundation allowing investigators and support staff to develop strong leads. Investigators must be prepared to ask every question\u2014albeit inane or delicate\u2014in order to ensure they are getting all of the existing, relevant information on the case. This is a process called fact-finding, in which a victim or witness\u2019s statement is documented and entered into record, thereby allowing investigators to thoroughly vet every aspect of their statement. Were they in fact present when the incident took place? Can they accurately describe the alleged perpetrator? Is their story consistent across multiple iterations? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As is the case with any investigation, operatives are racing against the clock. With time, witnesses\u2019 memories fade and witnesses themselves disappear, having relocated or simply left town. As time goes by, evidence is eroded, eventually disappearing, eliminating the leads they might have developed. This is why thorough fact-finding is so important, because investigators who are operating off false or inaccurate leads can lose days or weeks on a case as they chase a lead that will eventually come to no end. While investigators chase those dead leads, the truth about what actually occurred dissolves into obscurity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investigators in the Smollett case were able to vet his account of events and discover there may be more to the story than meets the eye. The case was not an isolated incident of allegedly false accusations having major consequences for the parties involved. Regardless of why an individual would make false accusations\u2014whether it was with malice or simply a mistake\u2014these circumstances could occur in many areas of life that could be devastating to both individuals and corporations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allegations of misconduct in the workplace immediately come to mind. Whether it\u2019s allegations of theft or sexual harassment, these are the kinds of cases where it\u2019s crucial to have the intake narrative well-documented, with detailed first accounts from all principles on the who, where, when, how, and why in any series of events. Cases regarding misconduct in the workplace have a higher chance of being litigated following the completion of any investigation, usually through civil and wrongful termination lawsuits. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A thorough and diligent private investigator is an invaluable asset to both sides of any investigation, as they are an independent third party and do not have a stake in the outcome of the investigation. Any fact-finding performed by an objective third party stands up to a much higher degree of scrutiny by the opposition. Investigators who are directly employed by any parties in either side have a lot to lose if their employer faces ruin following a lawsuit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which brings us to another issue in handling the fact-finding internally. Internal investigators can have a variety of qualifications depending on the corporation\u2019s procedure. It\u2019s true some businesses have licensed investigators on retainer to assist in regular operations, like a business who hires a private investigator to run a background check on a candidate for an upper management position. However, depending on the size of the company, the investigating party in some corporate crises is just the head of Human Resources\u2014who might then be supervising other subordinates to do the legwork. Human Resource managers are invaluable employees who keep businesses running like clockwork, but this does not necessarily qualify them to conduct an investigation in every possible scenario, such as investigations requiring surveillance, undercover work, or properly documenting any evidence that might be recovered. This kind of oversight can have disastrous consequences in the later stages of an investigation, or even in a court of law. The opposition\u2019s case is strengthened when there is evidence an internal investigator has not done their due-diligence. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Corporations of all sizes, trades, and levels of notoriety experience crises throughout their history. When disaster strikes and the stakes are high, it\u2019s important to retain the services of a qualified, licensed, private investigator to begin an investigation. It\u2019s not uncommon for a private investigator to be hired on after internal investigators have already made an attempt. It\u2019s best to start strong, with due-diligent service from a seasoned external investigator to lay an impenetrable foundation for a thorough investigation. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even if you\u2019re not a fan of Fox\u2019s successful prime time drama, Empire, you\u2019re likely aware of the name Jussie Smollett by now.
