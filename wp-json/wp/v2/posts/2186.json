The city of\nLouisville, Kentucky is synonymous with so many well-known aspects of American\nCulture. It\u2019s the home of legendary boxer, Muhammad Ali, the annual Kentucky\nDerby, Louisville Slugger bats, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. It\u2019s a vibrant\ncultural hub smack in the middle of America that combines metropolis energy\nwith southern charm. Despite the fact that it\u2019s one of the safest cities in\nAmerica, Louisville also experiences a higher rate of violent crime than the\nU.S. as a whole. With The speed, anonymity, and geo-social aspects of the city\nmake it an ideal place for a private investigator to set up shop. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relative to its size and population, Louisville is\ncomparable to Baltimore or Glasgow (U.K.). It has a crime rate of 647 violent\ncrimes per 100,000 people. In 2017 the Louisville Metropolitan Police\nDepartment fielded 4,428 violent crimes, 44% of the entire state total. That\u2019s\nan average of 12 violent crimes reported every day. Even police departments\nthat are well-funded and well-manned have difficulty juggling the caseload per\ninvestigator, and that is where private investigators come in. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private investigators as a profession have a reputation for seedy\nsurveillance and cloak-and-dagger tactics, but the same services that expose\ncheating spouses and hidden assets can assist in casework for violent crime. In\na 2018 investigative piece, Louisville\u2019s radio station WFPL 89.3 reported that\nLMPD closed 51% of its open rape cases over the course of three years. However,\nthe Louisville station also determined that in a majority of those cases, they\nclosed them with the classification of \u201ccleared by exception,\u201d a status meant\nfor cases considered \u201cexceptional situations,\u201d often resulting in no arrests.\nThis has been characterized as Louisville\u2019s PD attempt to improve their closure\nrate. Jessie Halladay, a spokesperson for Louisville Metropolitan Police\nDepartment said, \u201cWhat it means is that we have done all that we can. We don\u2019t\nuse that as a marker of success when we use \u2018cleared by exception.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case closure does not mean there\u2019s closure for the survivors\nof these brutal crimes. In the best-case scenario of \u201ccleared by exception,\u201d it\ncould simply mean that the Louisville police hit a roadblock in investigative\nmethods such as witness location, evidence-gathering, or jurisdictional\nboundaries that prevent them from investigating further. Private investigators\nhave a similar tool chest to that of law enforcement officers. Survivors of\nviolent crime without closure in their case can <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/04\/dont-wait-hire-private-investigator\/\">hire\nprivate investigators<\/a> to pick the case up where law enforcement left\noff\u2014locating vital witnesses, performing surveillance, and documenting casework\nthat can be helpful if the case is resurrected within the justice system, or if\nthe survivor wishes to face their attacker in civil court. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Private-Investigator.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2188\" width=\"354\" height=\"285\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the nation\u2019s foremost experts in missing persons, private investigator Thomas Lauth (Lauth Investigations) recently expanded his independent investigation firm to serve the Louisville population. \u201cWhen cities like Louisville have difficulty closing cases within their respective police departments, that\u2019s where private investigators can \u2018pick up the slack,\u2019 for lack of a better phrase. We can follow leads that law enforcement cannot and we can bring justice to survivors of violent crime who previously had no recourse.\u201d With their autonomy, private investigators can pick up leads that law enforcement might have dropped, or locate witnesses that might have left the jurisdiction. Lauth went on to say that Louisville provides some <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2018\/12\/plain-sight-private-investigators-blend\/\">unique opportunities <\/a>for a variety of investigations. \u201cCities the size of Louisville have a level of CCTV surveillance that is beneficial in investigations for locating witnesses, getting accurate accounts of how an incident transpired, or capturing license plates for investigations involving vehicles.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When police departments are overwhelmed, private\ninvestigators can pick up the slack, and bring closure to victims of violent\ncrime or otherwise. They possess a similar skill set, juxtaposed with a level\nof autonomy not afforded to law enforcement. This means jurisdictional issues\nwill never be a hurdle to stall case progression. Because private investigators\nonly have 3-4 cases on average at any given time, that means caseload will\nnever interfere with their ability to follow a lead in a timely matter. This\ncan lead to the recovery of new evidence, witness statements, and ultimately,\nclosure in your case.
