While it\u2019s true that many employers opt for background checks on employees in their hiring process, not every employer exercises the proper amount of due-diligence in clearing a prospective employee to work. While different job descriptions will demand different levels of due-diligence, and each field will require a different focus within a person\u2019s background, the bottom line is that some employers fail to go the extra mile when searching for the right person for the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Background checks for employees are a common-sense investment in the long-term health of your business. Background checks, when conducted thoroughly and properly, can provide invaluable insight into the candidate being considered for employment. Comprehensive background checks for employees reduce turnover, prevent losses, and protects the social ecosystem of the workplace from things like hostile work environments, decreases in productivity, and erosion of profits. When your business model places employees in close contact with customers in a transient capacity\u2014as in employees regularly service different customers every day in close proximity, typically offsite away from official company property\u2014those employers must go the extra mile in securing comprehensive background checks for employees<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a prime example of why companies must invest in comprehensive background checks for employees, look no further than the ride-share company, Uber. By the very nature of its design, ride-sharing is a system that can place both the drivers and their passengers at risk of physical harm. From the beginning of 2018 to the end of 2019, Uber had received more than 6,000 sexual assault complaints against their drivers. That number sheds a powerful light on a disturbing problem within the company\u2019s hiring processes. &#8220;At the scale that Uber operates, we&#8217;re going to see both the good and the bad that happens in society because we&#8217;re operating so many trips every single day,&#8221; said Tony West, Uber&#8217;s chief legal officer. Because the nature of ride-sharing places customers in such close, private quarters with their drivers, the threshold for what the company considers fit to drive must be higher. Though Uber claims to thoroughly vet or otherwise screen each employee before they are hired, thee has been testimony from former Uber drivers who said that they began driving the same day they applied\u2014not nearly enough time for a thorough background check into the driver\u2019s history. This can leave Uber open to various forms of litigation on behalf of the victims, including fines and settlements that will erode profits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now imagine the company in question isn\u2019t Uber, a multi-million-dollar corporation. The financial impact of even one lawsuit on behalf of a victim who was assaulted by an employee can be devastating to a small business. When your business model places employees in close personal quarters with customers, it\u2019s imperative that you keep the safety of your customers and your business protected. Lauth investigators are there for our clients when they need comprehensive intelligence on a candidate\u2019s background.
