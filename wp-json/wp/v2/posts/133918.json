You <em>know<\/em> that when executives and employees fall into a synergistic rhythm of getting things done, mountains can be moved. However, when that cohesive energy becomes elusive, it can be difficult to know what to do next. What causes that optimal functionality to flourish or fail? Fundamentally, the answer lies within shared culture. When productivity starts to sour, pin pointing how to improve corporate culture is just the ticket for getting things back on track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is Corporate Culture?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When we describe company culture or organizational culture, what exactly do we mean? In essence, this type of culture can be defined as the personality of any given organization. It is the values, attitudes, beliefs, and motivations that are shared by everyone involved. The impact of this can be found within the way coworkers connect and collaborate, the way customers and external associates are treated, and the efficiency and innovation seen across the board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last decade has been abuzz with talk of businesses striving to improve their corporate culture. Driving this trend is data indicating that stronger internal culture delivers enhanced employee engagement, greater talent attraction and retention, and a powerful boost to the bottom line. Some businesses fall into the trap of imagining that culture can be corrected with the sweeping introduction of new perks or a change in office aesthetics, but in truth the key is more human than that. Forging unstoppable culture means strategically empowering and uniting employees. So, let&#8217;s explore how to improve corporate culture from the ground up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Corporate Culture by Design<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before tackling existing culture and identifying how to shift it for the better, it is vital to lay out a blue print. This begins with revisiting the core values, mission statement, and employee value proposition of your organization, and confirming that they align not only with your business goals, but also with your corporate culture goals. Strong organizational culture is built upon both shared intentions and a shared sense of identity. Defining each of these clearly serves as an optimal launch point for infusing your team with a solid sense of direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Engage Your Team in the Creation Process<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your current corporate culture road map is lacking, deviations from optimal practices can become predictable, and the need for costly corporate investigations may follow. An effective way to encourage your most tenured team members, executives, and HR personnel to invest on a personal level in correcting this is to invite them to participate in the creative process required. Surveys and interviews will allow you to enlist the help of your human assets as you identify the current strength and weaknesses of existing culture, and the values that will serve as guiding lights moving forwards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Modeling Corporate Culture<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to both forging and reinforcing company culture, leaders must never forget that all eyes are on them. \u201cDo as I say and not as a I do\u201d will not stir motivation or emotional investment, but leading by example certainly will. In practical terms, this means not only modeling the behavior and attitudes that you want to see in your team, but also recognizing and elevating positive behaviors, and constructively calling out negative ones. Celebrate team wins, and take advantage of the potential <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apollotechnical.com\/employee-recognition-statistics\/\">59% reduction in turnovers<\/a> that employee recognition can provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Forge Trust With Operational Transparency<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to employee satisfaction, morale, and motivation, communication is essential. Keeping employees abreast of targets through timely updates allows them to see the strategy behind their daily efforts. When open communication, clear objectives, and employee recognition are combined, leadership and team members alike are given the ingredients required for cooperative and innovative thinking. Implementing dependable opportunities for employees to both give and receive feedback allows you to track employee engagement, stay ahead of problems, and utilize opportunities that would otherwise remain unseen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Call On an Expert<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are wondering how to improve corporate culture in order to strengthen your organization, or are facing down an impending corporate investigations crisis, external expert assistance can provide an immediate path towards favorable outcomes.
