Everyone expects or at least hopes the agreement will be respected by both parties, but that isn\u2019t always the case. When you suspect child custody agreement violations and potential abuse, you need to document them and keep records. That may sound like a lot, but here are tips to make keeping records a little easier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Take pictures<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The easiest way to document violations and abuse is by using the camera on your phone to take pictures. If you think you see bruises, cuts, or marks on your child then you should be taking pictures of them. Photographic evidence is some of the strongest evidence one can have.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Timestamps will tell you the date and time the picture was taken. By default most phones have timestamps on every picture they take, but make sure your\u2019s does too. If it doesn\u2019t have timestamps then go into the app store on your phone and find an app that does it. It won\u2019t be hard.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Write down notes and details in a journal or notebook<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The details are important in cases of child custody agreement violations and abuse. No matter how good your memory is, recording as much information as soon after it happens as possible will help in court. If you write about the events and pair them with the timestamped photographs it will bolster credibility.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Back-up your data<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">When are records useless? When they don\u2019t exist. You must back-up all of your data and records. No one thinks it will happen to them, but one power surge and your hard drive is fried. One slip and your phone is shattered on the pavement. Backing-up your files requires little to no extra effort and can be automated on most devices.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">If you\u2019re taking pictures on an iPhone, make sure your saving the photos to iCloud. If something happens to your phone you\u2019ll be able to download the photos to a new one or to a computer. On Android and iPhone you can plug your phone into your computer and back it up to the computer\u2019s hard drive. Back-up your data at least once a week and anytime you&#8217;re saving something of particular importance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Hire a private investigator <\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Proving violations of the agreement and abuse can be difficult. Depending on how often you get to see your child or the time you need to work each week, your ability to track everything your ex is doing might be limited. How can you prove your children are being taken places they\u2019re not allowed to be at?<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Private investigators have nothing but time for their clients and can document everything while keeping an eye on your children. If anything happens that violates your custody agreement then it will be documented. If there is abuse happening you will get the proof you need for court. PIs can be your eyes and ears and help you protect your children.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For Private Investigation Inquiry contact Thomas Lauth, Lauth Investigations <a href=\"tel:317-951-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">317-951-1100<\/a><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>David Schroeder, Blog Writer, Lauth Investigations International<\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What good is a child custody agreement if you\u2019re unable to have it properly enforced?
