Whether it\u2019s caring for new life in the household\u2014such as a newborn or a foster child\u2014or to care for an ailing relative, the 1993 act protects employees from being terminated from their jobs when they must take an extended absence for a specific set of reasons. However, abuses of FMLA are extremely common in the American workforce. <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/fmla-investigations\/\">While suspicions of FMLA abuse should be taken seriously by employers, companies must conduct thorough and unbiased investigations before terminating any employees.<\/a> Businesses who do not follow protocol can open themselves up to expensive litigation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to protecting employees from termination during an extended leave, FMLA also requires their various insurance coverage remain in effect. This protection can be guaranteed for up to 12 weeks. According to the Department of Labor:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FMLA is designed to help employees balance their work and family responsibilities by allowing them to take reasonable unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. It also seeks to accommodate the legitimate interests of employers and promote equal employment opportunity for men and women.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FMLA applies to all public agencies, all public and private elementary and secondary schools, and companies with 50 or more employees. These employers must provide an eligible employee with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year for any of the following reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the birth and care of the newborn child of an employee;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of FMLA within these guidelines (with some exceptions) is designed to protect hard-working men and women from losing their jobs when their family suddenly requires their attention. Life can change so fast, and employees can rest easy knowing their jobs will be waiting for them when they are able to return in top-performing condition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Charlie Plumb, an attorney who represents clients in all phases of management, abuse of this protection should be investigated, provided the employer has an \u201chonest suspicion.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cThis honest suspicion standard is really intended to protect the employer against a claim they are interfering against FMLA leave and\/or being retaliatory.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A familiar scenario is one where an employee has been granted leave under FMLA for a serious illness or injury. The employer then happens to see posts from the employee on social media having fun out with friends, exercising, or driving. The employer might think, \u201cIf they\u2019re well enough to do these things, they must be well enough to work.\u201d While this might sound like an open and shut case from the employer\u2019s point of view, Allen Smith of The Society of Human Resources Management, provides an example where this philosophy proved problematic:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cJoan Casciari, an attorney with Seyfarth Shaw in Chicago, said she handled a case that involved an employee who was put on FMLA leave for depression. The employer later discovered, through surveillance, she was doing Christmas shopping with her family and having a wonderful time. But her doctor confirmed &#8220;retail therapy&#8221; was consistent with her condition and the fact she could shop did not mean she did not require FMLA leave.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily for the employer in this anecdote, they did their due diligence and consulted a medical professional who could corroborate the circumstances of her FMLA qualifications. Some employers are far hastier. When employers do not conduct comprehensive and objective investigations into suspicious FMLA claims, they can open themselves up to lawsuits that can be devastatingly expensive and a public relations nightmare. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vigilance of adherence to the guidelines of FMLA becomes manageable when Human Resource directors keep an eye out for certain patterns of behavior, such as absence patterns, especially when they coincide with non-work events (holidays or something personal that they may have mentioned in the past). Employers should also be suspicious of absences directly contradicting any medical certification in frequency or duration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once an employer has a reasonable suspicion of FMLA abuse, they should most certainly investigate. However, internal investigations into these kinds of abuses can be very messy for Human Resources and upper management. The aforementioned scenario involving \u201cretail therapy\u201d could have been a disaster if the company had not done their due diligence. Some employers are not so diligent. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another scenario involving a maintenance worker at a nursing home and rehabilitation center panned out much differently. The employee in question noticed his superior was exhibiting a pattern of absence he found suspicious. He began reviewing surveillance footage to compare to his own personal log of her comings and goings in order to prove she was abusing company time. After discovering the independent investigation, the superior served a series of performance adjustments to the employee before terminating him. The termination came after the employee had submitted an FMLA request. The court found the dates of his termination tied in too closely with his request for FMLA, allowing the employee to take the case to trial. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scenarios like these are why Human Resources and management should 1) be vigilant of FMLA abuse, and 2) conduct a thorough and unbiased investigation in order to ensure the company is protected from litigation. Many companies choose to handle investigations internally in order to minimize the amount of exposure. However, internal investigations spearheaded by current members of staff, will not only disrupt daily operations, but can also have negative effects like the case of the nursing home. The employee conducting his own investigation may have had honest suspicions of his superior\u2019s misconduct, but he was certainly not a unbiased source to investigate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private investigators are probative routes often overlooked when a company has an internal investigation. There are many circumstances under which companies do not want to give up control over an internal investigation, and a private investigator is the definition of a third-party. However, the objectivity of a private investigator is the number one reason why companies should consider them as an option. The personal biases of the persons involved in the previous examples caused the investigation to go south. As an independent contractor, a private investigator\u2019s only loyalty is to the truth. They are vital to ensuring an investigation is a transparent expedition for the truth. This goes a long way towards protecting a business from subsequent lawsuits or bad press. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When handling an investigation internally, employers are limited to what surveillance they can attain from their own equipment or social media. Private investigators are licensed to track individuals and photograph their activity in public. Persons who fraudulently claim to be out for injury can be photographed doing tasks directly contradicting their FMLA claim, like yardwork or lifting heavy groceries. In addition to tracking their public movements, private investigators may also conduct undercover operations in order to investigate any frauds. They are invaluable in this regard as they are not known to those within the company. Whether you\u2019re looking for an FMLA weekender or an FMLA moonlighter, if someone has made a fraudulent FMLA claim, a private investigator is the most-equipped professional to prove or disprove the suspicion. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides working families balance to their lives when their circumstances take a turn.
