With their specialized skills and knowledge, private investigators can be the perfect multi-tool for attorney support when it comes to intelligence-gathering in their casework. While it&#8217;s true that many attorneys utilize private investigators, the full breadth of their capabilities is only as limited as the imagination of the attorney. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are just a few of the ways in which private investigators can be of invaluable assistance to attorneys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Combing Databases in eDiscovery<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/pexels-sora-shimazaki-5668837-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"attorney support \" class=\"wp-image-160996\" width=\"352\" height=\"469\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Attorney support comes in many forms, but private investigators are especially helpful when it comes to the wealth of documents and records in electronic form. When it comes to eDiscovery, or electronic discovery, private investigators have the access and experience with comprehensive databases that attorneys or their paralegals may find overwhelming. Private investigators have access to a wide range of databases and public records that can be used to gather valuable information about a case. This includes criminal records, driving records, financial records, and more. By combing through these databases, private investigators can uncover crucial information that may be difficult or impossible for attorneys to obtain on their own. eDiscovery is especially applicable to investigations with high, comprehensive levels of information, such as asset searches, background investigations, and social media investigations. A private investigator will not only have the skills to sort through this information, but also have the eye for the most important details, and can organize the information in a way that best suits an attorney&#8217;s needs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Locating Witnesses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important tasks that private investigators can perform in attorney support is locating witnesses. In many cases, witnesses are reluctant to come forward or may be difficult to find. Private investigators have the skills and resources to track down witnesses, interview them, and gather valuable information that can help attorneys build a stronger case. In many cases, witnesses are unwilling to come forward because they fear reprisal by law enforcement, fear for their safety, or simply do not want to be involved. However, because private investigators have no powers of arrest, work under the professional cloak of discretion, and have excellent people skills, they are often well-suited to not only locating witnesses, but also developing a rapport with them that makes them more willing to open up about facts in a case.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Offering Expert Testimony<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to gathering information and locating witnesses, private investigators can also offer expert testimony on the stand during court proceedings. As highly trained professionals, private investigators can provide valuable insights and analysis based on their knowledge and experience. This can be especially helpful in cases where complex or technical issues are involved. Though private investigators are retained by attorneys, unless they are employed directly by the attorney themselves, their subcontractor status does offer a greater deal of objectivity when it comes to the solution for a case. Their third-party testimony will stand up to a higher degree of scrutiny in court than an in-house investigator. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conducting Surveillance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Private investigators are also skilled at conducting surveillance, which can be a valuable tool for attorneys in many types of cases. Whether it&#8217;s tracking the movements of a person of interest or gathering evidence to support a claim, private investigators can use a variety of techniques to conduct surveillance discreetly and effectively. A private investigator with a great eye for detail in surveillance is particularly important in matters of workplace investigations, such as harassment and discrimination, worker&#8217;s compensation, or white-collar crime. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Providing Support and Guidance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, private investigators can provide valuable attorney support and guidance to attorneys throughout the course of a case. From helping to develop a strategy to providing regular updates on the progress of an investigation, private investigators can be a valuable partner to attorneys as they work to build a strong case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, private investigators can be the perfect multi-tool for attorneys when it comes to intelligence-gathering in their casework. From combing databases and locating witnesses to offering expert testimony on the stand and providing support and guidance throughout the case, private investigators can be an invaluable asset to any legal team. If you&#8217;re an attorney looking to build a strong case, consider working with a private investigator to help you gather the information you need to succeed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Private investigators are highly trained professionals who are often called upon to assist attorneys with a variety of tasks related to their casework.
