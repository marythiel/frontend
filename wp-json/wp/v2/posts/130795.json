The violence is another in a string of shootings in the workplace that\nhas corporate leadership wondering what their role is in limiting these acts of\nviolence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The victims in the Milwaukee Molson Coors shooting were identified as Jesus Valle Jr., 33; Gennady Levshetz, 61; Trevor Wetselaar, 33; Dana Walk, 57; and Dale Hudson, 60. The shooter, electrician Anthony N. Ferrill, 51, is deceased as well. Those victims, Ferrill\u2019s coworkers, are remembered by the dozens of friends and family they left behind, as well as a community rocked by violence. Molson Coors chief executive Gavin Hattersley said in a news conference, \u201cThey were husbands, they were fathers, and they were friends. They were a part of the fabric of our company and our community, and we will miss them terribly.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many acts of violence in the workplace are perpetrated\nby former employees, Anthony Ferrill was a current employee of Molson Coors.\nFerrill worked in the building\u2019s utilities department. While authorities have\nnot established a clear motive for the shooting, according to the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2020\/03\/02\/milwaukee-molson-coors-shooting-miller-brewery-anthony-ferrill\/4928061002\/\">\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel,<\/a> Ferrill had a history of dispute with his coworkers\nthat many have speculated finally came to a head in the events leading up to last\nweek\u2019s shooting. The dispute may have had racial overtones, with Ferrill\naccusing other employees of discriminating against him in the workplace. He had\nsuspicions that other employees were trespassing at his home, bugging his\nelectronic devices, and disturbing his property. With the exception of one man,\nFerrill had previous confrontations with all the victims, yet police have\ndeclined to comment on how the shooting occurred. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When shocking incidents of violence like this occur in the workplace,\nit\u2019s not uncommon to hear from leadership in the organization that they are \u2018shocked,\u2019\nor \u2018astonished\u2019 at the events that have taken place, or that the violence was\nperpetrated by a member of their organization. The reality is that active\nshooter events and other forms of violence in the workplace can usually be\nanticipated and prevented if leadership is not asleep at the wheel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most workplace crises, from violence to theft, can be traced\nback to faulty internal operations. That\u2019s why so many corporations are seeking\nto have their daily operations evaluated by independent investigators and risk\nassessment firms. These investigators come into your business and begin examining\nhiring processes, onboarding materials, employee engagement, and the turnover\nrate in an attempt to identify the problems that cause frustration within the organization.\nIn the unfortunate example of Molsen Coors, there was obviously room for more\nsupervision with regards to intra-employee conflict. If the alleged\nintra-employee conflict had been given more attention, it might not have ended\nin violence. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate Culture Audit investigators can provide leadership with the insight they need to improve their daily operations. Investigators can review hiring protocol, identifying risk factors and lack of oversight. They can review security systems, both in cyberspace, and at brick-and-mortar locations to identify weaknesses that would leave the company vulnerable to attack. These are measures that could have prevented the violence that broke out at Molson Coors, and they can protect your company, too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your corporation or organization needs a corporate\nculture audit, call Lauth Investigations International today for a free quote\non our corporate culture audit program.
