Seeing as how November 1<sup>st<\/sup> is the 305<sup>th<\/sup> day in the calendar year, it would appear that the spike in active shooter events in recent years will not slow down any time soon. While schools redefine their safety protocols and implement programs that prepare students for these events, employers throughout the United States are also beginning to understand the importance of preparing their workforce for an active shooter event.\n\nThe year of 2017 broke the record for the most mass-shooting deaths every recorded\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/5010973\/sutherland-springs-texas-mass-shootings-history\/\">112 deaths<\/a>, well exceeding the amount in any other year in recorded history. In 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clomedia.com\/2018\/06\/08\/how-to-prepare-for-active-shooters-in-the-workplace\/\">the Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/a> published a report that showed another spike in workplace homicides. According to them, there were 83 workplace homicides in 2015, a number that skyrocketed to 500 for the year of 2018 alone. A terrifying 79% of those cases were the result of an active shooter. As a result, the desire for employee active shooter training has never been higher, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/02\/11\/466416680\/at-many-workplaces-training-for-a-new-threat-active-shooters\">NPR<\/a> reporting that as of 2016, 75-80% of employers are seeking qualified active shooter training to protect their workforce.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dhs.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/active-shooter-pocket-card-508.pdf\">The Department of Homeland Security<\/a> has a myriad of resources on their website for dealing with active shooters. One of them is a pocket-card that outlines the characteristics of an active shooter event, \u201cVictims are selected at random. The event is unpredictable and evolves quickly. Law enforcement is usually required to end an active shooter situation.\u201d &nbsp;Active shooters may fire at random, using no discernible criteria for their victims, but that arbitration should not be misunderstood.

While keeping their hands visible, they should leave their belongings behind and run to safety as quick as possible, assisting others if needed.\n\n<strong>Hide<\/strong>\n\nOnce they\u2019ve reached safety (or if escape is impossible) the Department of Homeland Security recommends hiding immediately in a location out of the shooter\u2019s line of sight. Individuals should block the door or manner of entry into their hiding spot and silence their cell phones and pagers. Sit very quietly and wait for first-responders to find you.\n\n<strong>Fight<\/strong>\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security lists this option as an absolute last resort in the event of an active shooter in the workplace. Your life should be in immediate danger, and you should be well-positioned to act with physical aggression and incapacitate the shooter.\n\nMany third-party security companies also endorse the methods of Homeland Security, but there are others that take a different approach. Laurence Barton, a workplace violence expert, recommends employers seek training programs that promote a culture of safety and preparedness\u2014not fear. In lieu of careful research regarding active shooter training, many employers opt for the simple, cost-effective route by showing employees the prolific training video produced by the city of Houston, which features graphic depictions of employees being shot. \u201cWhen some companies have created these videos that show blood and guts\u2014that\u2019s not in any way the kind of learning that stays with people. In fact, it repulses them\u2026employees get scared,\u201d Barton says, \u201cI just don\u2019t believe scaring people is the way to teach them. It just promotes anxiety.\u201d Aric Mutchnick, the president of a risk management firm called <a href=\"http:\/\/experiorgroupinc.com\/\">the Experior Group<\/a>, agrees with Barton, \u201cCops or military guys like to have it very realistic because they think the more real it is, the more they can find out. That is true if you\u2019re a tactical team, but you can\u2019t apply tactical training to a civilian population.\u201d Mutchnick points out that the equal distribution of choice laid down by the Department of Homeland Security\u2014run, hide, or fight\u2014is not only dangerous, but unrealistic, \u201cIt should be 90 percent run, 8 percent hide <em>until you can run<\/em>, and then as for fight, really? Are you kidding? I don\u2019t know how you would even train on that.\u201d Companies like Experior Group also recommend that a base knowledge of firearms should also be part of the training, not so employees can operate firearms, but so their knowledge can inform their escape. Civilians who are ignorant of basic firearm operations can easily be paralyzed by fear because they are uncertain of a weapons range or magazine size. This gives an active shooter ample opportunity to change their position and reload without fear of retaliation.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1928 lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/activeshooter__12181450313950.jpg\" alt=\"active shooter\" width=\"1121\" height=\"748\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 1121px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 1121\/748;\">\n\nFrozen with fear\u2014it\u2019s something we can all relate to.

Some of the most prolific risk management and security companies are headed by former members of law enforcement or the military. This experience with weapons and chaos not only validates the content for many employers, but also leaves employees empowered with credible knowledge. However, former navy seals and swat team leaders are not the only option when it comes to the instructor. Lauren Perry, the vice president of operations for Trident Shield, often addresses training groups.

With many training programs averaging in the realm of thousands of dollars, employers often question whether or not active shooter training is even necessary.
