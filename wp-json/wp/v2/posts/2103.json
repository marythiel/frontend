Cyber-security product developers are on an infinite loop with felons, each trying to out fox the other with regards to data breaches. Security is absolutely necessary for brick and mortar establishments due to a myriad of reasons, but in 2019, the name of the game is cyber-security. Not only are data breaches an efficient <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/brand-protection\/\">way to steal trade secrets<\/a> and financial information from businesses, but they can also be done remotely. A proficient hacker or scammer can access a company\u2019s vital company information from halfway across the world, and from that same location, can devastate the company. Within minutes, they can access financial information, trade secrets, distribution and delivery schedules, and private customer information. To prevent this from happening to your business, here are 5 cyber security measures every business should have: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Iron-clad Passwords <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Internet 101. Since the birth of the World Wide Web, we\u2019ve been educating adults and children alike on the importance of having a strong password to access online accounts. Whether it\u2019s a company\u2019s financial information, or a Grubhub app on an executive\u2019s phone, thieves can crack weak passwords to gain access. As such, it\u2019s important passwords never contain personal information about an individual, especially if that information is visible on social media. Parents often include the name of their kids in their passwords, using their dates of birth for any numerical value requirement. Teens and young adults use the name of their favorite animal, sport, or music artist. Another common tactic is using common words that are easy to remember, and then spelling them backwards for a false sense of security. Experts at the National Cyber Security Alliance also do not recommend using sequences of characters that are near each other on the keyboard, such as \u201cQWERTY,\u201d the first six characters of the keyboard. The current recommended length for strong passwords is between 8-12 characters. If you\u2019re unsure whether or not you password is secure, use an online password checker to verify the passwords level of\u00a0 cyber security. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Fortified Firewalls <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firewalls have been around almost as long as passwords. Firewalls are shields that protect your business from harmful or insidious traffic. When you connect to the internet, the system is constantly communicating with the wireless network, both sending and receiving units of information known as packets. Firewalls monitor these packets and perform a risk assessment, blocking unsafe packets. These firewalls protect your company\u2019s data from unauthorized remote access by criminals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Antivirus Protection <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roland Cloutier, the Chief Security Officer for ADP, calls antivirus software \u201cthe last line of defense\u201d when protecting your company\u2019s data from hackers and other cyber-criminals. Not only can remote criminals access and view a company\u2019s vital information, but they can also install vicious malware that will copy the target\u2019s hard drive, and subsequently render the machine inoperable. Installing anti-virus and anti-malware programs aren\u2019t enough, though. These programs need to be updated regularly as part of the infinite loop mentioned earlier. Every time a criminal finds a way to bypass an anti-malware product, the product requires changes to combat those breaches. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Laptops and Mobile Phones<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/02\/sim-card-swapping-scams-leave-businesses-vulnerable\/\">secure laptop computers and mobile smartphones<\/a> associated with your business. For this, experts recommend encryption software so any remote felon attempting to access or copy the hard drive cannot do so without the proper password. They also stress the importance of never leaving these devices in ones vehicle, where they are easily accessible to thieves. \u201cLock-out\u201d options are also standard for these devices in 2019. This setting allows you to establish a time period during which the phone lies idle. After that period expires, the phone locks itself, preventing anyone from accessing it without the password. Smartphones and laptops with remote-wipe features must be enabled. This way, if your device falls into the wrong hands, you can remotely wipe the device and prevent the leak of sensitive company information. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Employee Education<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last, but never least, it\u2019s important your workforce is educated on the security measures in place and regularly enforces them on a day-to-day basis. Companies often neglect employee education under the false impression their IT team will be able to resolve all issues whenever they arise. The fact is, even IT professionals cannot anticipate every cyber threat, and may not be up-to-date on the very latest in cyber-criminal tactics. An ounce of this education is worth a pound of cure\u2014Despite the level of technology literacy in the United States in 2019, an employer or business owner cannot assume an employee\u2019s level of security knowledge. The prevention starts with employees, providing them with an intimate knowledge of company operations and how cyber security measures protect them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Regardless of your company&#8217;s industry or size, all businesses must update and maintain their cyber security. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when criminals can bypass cyber security, and devastate a company in minutes.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cyber criminals are evolving at an alarming rate.
