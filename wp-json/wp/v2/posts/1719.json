Most people would be ecstatic to realize they forgot to empty their pockets but what happens to money you don\u2019t know exists? Hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may be surprised how many people in this country have unclaimed assets they may never know existed . . . unless they look for it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, it is estimated local, state and federal agencies collectively hold more than $58 billion in unclaimed assets, roughly $175 for every U.S. resident. However, experts estimate there may be as much as $100 billion languishing in unclaimed cash and benefits held in local, state and federal agencies. We do know, daily, the amount of unclaimed funds increases. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators, every state including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands has lost assets, commonly referred to as unclaimed funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>What are Lost Assets?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unclaimed property law or escheatment was first enacted in 1954. The purpose of the act is to provide a central repository in each state, so citizens can seek lost assets belonging to them. Each state maintains a comprehensive list of the unclaimed assets. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unclaimed funds are financial assets owed to an individual or business not claimed or have unknown ownership. Examples of unclaimed assets or funds are the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uncashed payroll checks <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dormant bank accounts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safe deposit boxes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refunds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer overpayments<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security deposits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurance payments<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unclaimed dividends<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unclaimed securities<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traveler\u2019s checks, money orders, cashier\u2019s checks<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Principal on debt<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escrow balances<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Old stock certificates<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mining Certificates<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mineral royalty payments<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retirement<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property held by courts and other governmental agencies<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All businesses must forward all unclaimed funds or property to their state in accordance with their state\u2019s escheat laws. Ideally, the state holds unclaimed funds in a trust and attempts to locate the rightful owner \u2013 except it doesn\u2019t always work in that way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, since 2006, a mere 5% of lost assets has been returned to rightful owners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1721 lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/money-locked-300x181.png\" alt=\"money locked\" width=\"723\" height=\"436\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 723px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 723\/436;\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>The Escheatment Process<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unclaimed property is governed by state laws requiring all unclaimed assets be turned over to the state to be held in trust. For example, if a bank account is inactive for a lengthy period, commonly within one year, the state can claim the funds in the account through a process known as escheatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Escheatment accounts are defined as dormant, unclaimed or abandoned. For instance, banks are responsible for reporting unclaimed property to the state after a certain amount of dormancy. Each state has a different time frame before the state escheats the assets to safeguard them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Arizona, a financial institution must report securities property after a period of 3 years dormancy and bonds after two years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The laws are strict. A company could be fined by the Arizona Department of Revenue a civil penalty of 25% of the value of the unclaimed asset or abandoned property or $100 per day up to $5,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only tangible property covered is the contents of safe deposit boxes. However, for contents of safe deposit boxes, periodic auctions are conducted by most states and proceeds from the sale of items are held for a rightful owner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While unclaimed, the policy for unclaimed funds is they should be used for the \u201cgreater good\u201d of the public, until such time as it is returned to the rightful owner. Without affecting the state\u2019s obligation to return unclaimed funds, collections are used to finance operations such as public schools and college scholarships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1951, the U.S. Supreme Court stated in the Standard Oil Co. vs New Jersey case, \u201cProperty that escapes seizure by would-be possessors and is used for the general good rather than the chance enrichment of particular individuals or organizations.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, $3.235 billion was returned by state government unclaimed property agencies to rightful owners or heirs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>What is an Heir?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An heir is the \u201crightful owner\u201d of lost assets\/funds or a person in ranking who is entitled to inherit property if the rightful owner is deceased, sometimes referred to as a logical heir. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An heir can be an individual or a company such as a business or corporation, church or charity, or hospital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1722 lazyload\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/unclaimed-funds-300x149.jpg\" alt=\"unclaimed funds\" width=\"713\" height=\"354\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 713px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 713\/354;\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Defining the Source<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A government database of centralized information does not exist; therefore, each federal agency maintains its own records.

Much of the time, people are second and third generation and the original rights are still in the parents or grandparents names who have passed away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While each state maintains their own database, the resources to find the owners of the property are minimal, even nonexistent. Some states advertise on their websites and others in the local newspapers. Clearly, with only 5% return on total lost assets, these methods are not effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the lack of a national database, finding lost assets can be difficult for most individuals and makes it necessary to find help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Finding Heirs<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to turning over unclaimed property to the state as required by law, businesses or holders of lost funds may conduct due diligence and often hire companies, referred to as heir finders, to assist in finding the rightful owner of unclaimed assets. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most states require heir finders to be licensed private investigators to protect consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One may think they don\u2019t need a private investigation firm to represent them; however, there are many benefits to hiring a private investigator to locate lost assets.
