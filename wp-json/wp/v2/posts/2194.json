Victims of this harassment have previously been restricted by a pervasive culture of silence and shame within the workplace\u2014a culture where reporters are vilified and characterized as dishonest people with an axe to grind. Now, with many victims of sexual harassment publicizing their experiences in the workplace, more and more people are feeling empowered to seek justice for their treatment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tcbusinessnews.com\/metoo-a-new-perspective-on-harassment-investigations\/\">Equal Opportunity Commission <\/a>(EEOC) reported in their annual fiscal report that sexual harassment filings had an overall increase of 13.6% from 2018. The EEOC also denoted that they secured nearly $70 million for the victims of sexual harassment through enforcement on behalf of administration. These are just a few ways that the EEOC is attempting to make themselves the new champions of workplace harassment reporting in effort to improve the culture around reporting and enforcement. The EEOC seeks to empower employers to create a corporate culture within their organization that does not demonize reporting and encourages thorough investigations of all claims. By fostering this open and transparent workplace culture, employers create spaces for their employees that are safe, respectful, and thriving environment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a myriad of reasons, employers may have difficulty in\nperforming due-diligence on sexual harassment claims. Whether the employer does\nnot find the complaint credible, or as a result of oversight, when no\ninvestigation is conducted into the complaint, the organization opens itself up\nto subsequent litigation and a public relations nightmare. However, there are\naffirmative defenses for employers who can document their attempts to create a\nsafe environment for their employees. One of the ways employers can document\nthis is by submitting their organization to a corporate culture audit. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A corporate culture audit is one of the best investments that an employer can make in 2019. These audits are typically conducted by independent risk assessment firms and in some cases, even <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/05\/internal-teams-vs-private-investigators\/\">private investigators<\/a>. In essence, a corporate culture audit is basically a check-up for a business or organization\u2014not unlike taking your car in for scheduled maintenance. An auditor will enter the work environment and conduct a series of assessments based on a previously-set agenda. The goal of the auditor is to review internal processes and the physical location (if applicable) and identify issues that could have negative consequences for the corporation or organization, such as faulty investigation procedures for internal complaints. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only can these audits protect businesses and organizations\nin the aftermath of a sexual harassment claim, but corporate culture audits can\nalso improve your business from within. What we know about the cycle of\ncorporate culture indicates that when employees feel valued, they are more\nengaged and more productive as a result. The audit also evaluates the\norganization\u2019s internal operations for efficacy and efficiency. By identifying\nflaws within internal operations, corporations can modify those procedures to increase\nproductivity. Corporate culture audits are an invaluable opportunity for\norganizations to bolster their business and improve the overall health of the\nworkplace. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to give your business a tune-up, call Lauth\nInvestigations International today for a free quote on our corporate culture\nprogram.
