Not only does it mark the end of a marriage, but it can become incredibly complicated, which can lead to a long, drawn out and painful process.

Here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Locate Hidden Assets<\/strong> &#8211; One of the biggest points of contention couples face when going through a divorce is that of mistrust over assets.

A private investigator who specializes in divorce cases can help make sure any and all assets are accounted for.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Uncover Infidelity<\/strong> &#8211; While many states offer no-fault divorce, some will still grant a more favorable settlement in the case of infidelity. Unfortunately, proving such a thing can be quite challenging. With the help of a seasoned private investigator, however, you may be able to uncover all the evidence you need to tilt the courts in your favor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Custody Battles<\/strong> &#8211; Under the best of circumstances, both parents should enjoy equal opportunity to have a relationship with their children following divorce. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t live in a perfect world and many situations are unhealthy for children. If you\u2019re concerned that your soon-to-be ex or former spouse is placing your kids at risk, a private eye can help gather the necessary proof to back up your claim in court.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Child Support\/Alimony<\/strong> &#8211; Regardless of which side of the coin you\u2019re on, determining what amount of child support and\/or alimony is fair can be a huge point of contention. If you feel you\u2019re paying too much based on misinformation provided by your former spouse, or you believe your ex is withholding information that would lead to a higher payout, a private investigator can help sort things out and ensure that everyone is operating on the up-and-up.<\/p>\n<p>Going through a divorce is difficult no matter what the circumstances.
