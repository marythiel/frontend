Instead, it claimed that its Texaco acquisition was being targeted for extortion by Petroecuador, the nation&#8217;s centralized governmental oil facility. It began a countersuit.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-20-at-6.53.09-AM.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-791 lazyload\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-04-20 at 6.53.09 AM\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-20-at-6.53.09-AM-300x197.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 300px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 300\/197;\" \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-20-at-6.53.34-AM.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-792 lazyload\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-04-20 at 6.53.34 AM\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-20-at-6.53.34-AM-300x193.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" style=\"--smush-placeholder-width: 300px; --smush-placeholder-aspect-ratio: 300\/193;\" \/><\/a>Local Testimony<\/p>\n<p>Although the company claimed to have cleaned up the contamination in 1998, local residents interviewed on the Chevron Tapes tell graphic stories about continual pollution that was merely covered up.<\/p>\n<p>Out of the dozens of tapes that were anonymously sent to Amazon Watch, there are hours of footage of native people drinking, washing, and working in contaminated soil and water. Oil sheen can be seen on everything from footprint indentations to deep core soil samples that Texaco took at unremediated well sites.<\/p>\n<p>Despite 10 years of <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/legal-investigations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">litigation<\/a>, the battle is ongoing. How it will end depends on information &#8211; and these tapes are a start.<\/p>\n<p>How an <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/legal-investigations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Investigator <\/a>Can Help<\/p>\n<p>In order for the Ecuadorians to truly make their case stick, they need more concrete evidence with a proven trail. That means, it&#8217;s time for the whistleblower to be found. Only when that person comes forward with his or her true identity can these incredible tapes gain the momentum and legal weight that they deserve.<\/p>\n<p>If the Ecuadorians were to hire a private investigator to look into the initial location of the tapes and do some digging, they would be able to get a face and name where they could go to for more information. Hiring an investigation firm like Lauth Investigations International would help them come up with the evidence that would prove their story once and for all.<\/p>\n<p>See the Chevron Tapes now:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe data-src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/l618BhvWkz4\" height=\"315\" width=\"420\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" data-load-mode=\"1\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>For more information about the case, check out these resources:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"title\">&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.csrwire.com\/press_releases\/37863-More-Secret-Videos-from-Chevron-Whistleblower-Show-Ecuadorian-Villager-Asking-for-Help-Oil-Giant-Never-Provided\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">More Secret Videos from Chevron Whistleblower Show Ecuadorian Villager Asking for Help Oil Giant Never Provided,<\/a>&#8221; <em>CSR Newswire<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/amazonwatch.org\/news\/2015\/0408-the-chevron-tapes-video-shows-oil-giant-allegedly-covering-up-amazon-contamination\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Chevron Tapes: Video Shows Oil Giant Allegedly Covering Up Amazon Contamination<\/a>,&#8221; <em>Amazon Watch<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.commondreams.org\/news\/2015\/04\/08\/chevron-whistleblower-leaks-smoking-gun-case-ecuadorian-oil-spill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chevron Whistleblower Leaks &#8216;Smoking Gun&#8217; in Case of Ecuadorian Oil Spill<\/a>,&#8221; <em>Common Dreams<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/karen-hinton\/current-findings-of-chevr_b_6959590.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Current Findings of Chevron&#8217;s Contamination in Ecuador &#8220;Just Scratch the Surface<\/a>,&#8221; Huffington Post<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems that Chevron will do anything to keep their corporate reputation pristine, including whitewashing soil samples that have been contaminated with oil.
