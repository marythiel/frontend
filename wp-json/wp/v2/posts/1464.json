Make sure the right employees are involved in the hiring process.\u00a0 Especially in large organizations, certain members can do more harm than good.\u00a0 For instance, in Yahoo&#8217;s case board members were heavily involved in major hiring decisions, causing strife with the HR department (aka people who are trained to hire others).\u00a0 This led to some obviously poor decisions including informal interviews without HR knowledge and\/or going through proper vetting channels.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 The higher the position, the more detailed and stringent the hiring process should be.\u00a0 Makes sense right? You&#8217;d be surprised at how this can often be reversed.\u00a0 Some suggested this occurs from not wanted to upset your potential CEO who might find it undignified. An HR exec at Pepsi-Co <a href=\"http:\/\/http:\/\/www.hreonline.com\/HRE\/view\/story.jhtml?id=533349962\">Suggests <\/a>that the &#8220;more senior you are, the more its about relationships and less about filling out an application.&#8221;\u00a0 Whatever the case may be, this backwards thinking has lead to many a company&#8217;s PR department having endless migraines.<\/p>\n<p>3. Vetting process isn&#8217;t just for the companies benefit.\u00a0 Being properly vetted helps the potential hire and not only through avoiding embarrassing public scrutiny.\u00a0 By having certain exaggerations or falsities come up through vetting, it allows the candidate the chance to correct the error and move on before it can scar them for life.<\/p>\n<p>4. Utilizing a third party for this process can avoid in-house biases.\u00a0 Hiring objective, experienced investigators can produce the best results without leaving hiring or HR department of the company in compromised positions.\u00a0 However, said department should still work closely with the investigators in order to receive the necessary information.<\/p>\n<p>5.\u00a0 Trying to understand the candidates psychology.\u00a0 Just because they passed a background check and have the necessary credentials doesn&#8217;t mean they should become the face for your organization.\u00a0 Trying to suss out cases of candidates too consumed with power or narcissism can be tricky, but there are options available.\u00a0 Going beyond a person&#8217;s references can stem from asking a reference particular questions or interviewing the potential hires previous employee underlings.\u00a0 Taking the time to go through such measures can help determine if he\/she would be proper fit for your company.<\/p>\n<p>6. Not just CEOs.\u00a0 Vetting techniques can and should be used for candidates of many industries.\u00a0 From the coach of professional sports organizations to higher ups in various form of academia, if you can be hired in a position of power, then the organization should take the time and due diligence to make sure you won&#8217;t come back to haunt them.<\/p>\n<p>(Source HRonline)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vetting is a process most often spoken of when it comes to political candidates.
