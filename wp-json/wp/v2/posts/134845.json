But in others instances, keeping your investigation under wraps can ultimately be the only way to mitigate damage, catch wrongdoers in the act, and prevent an escalation of impact to company reputation and financial standing. In these moments, a corporate investigator well versed in launching efficient and sound undercover investigations is the crucial ally you need in your corner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When evidence suggests that something nefarious is bubbling under the surface of your organization&#8217;s operations, there is always a risk that what you have detected is only the tip of the iceberg. To gain a sense of the scale of the issue, it&#8217;s important to recognize that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.embroker.com\/blog\/employee-theft-statistics\/\">90% of all significant theft losses<\/a> within the corporate world come from employees\u2014and that&#8217;s only one within a spectrum of immoral activities that could be happening right under your nose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Factors such as eroded company culture, patterns of <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/corporate-theft\/\">workplace theft<\/a>, malingering, and even catastrophic <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/white-collar-crime\/\">white collar crime<\/a> often go undetected by leadership for months until untold damage has been done. The salve to such risks is proactive and discreet action taken at the right time, offering the potential to thwart the misappropriation of company assets and resources. If you find yourself wondering what you are missing in your workplace, Lauth Investigations International is ready to assist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Types of Workplace Wrongdoing That Undercover Investigations Bring to Light<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever an employer has a clear sense of conduct violations or even criminality taking place under their roof\u2014or simply has a suspicion that all is not as it should be\u2014undercover investigations can reveal far more of what takes place in the workplace than any other form of surveillance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A highly trained covert corporate operative will be able to accurately evidence the things that your security systems and CCTV have missed, including issues such as product or property theft, <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/fraud-forgery\/\">fraud and forgery<\/a>, idling and malingering, substance-abuse, bullying and discrimination, <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/non-compete-violations\/\">non-compete violations<\/a>, safety and security issues, and much more beside.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A phenomenal amount of evidence gathering can take place with zero disruption to the workplace or any indication to wrongdoers that their actions are being monitored. Once the covert operation is concluded, further formal corporate investigations, disciplinary procedures, and legal action can be taken with confidence that the material evidence is in place to back every step up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Undercover Investigations Are So Effective<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether an employee&#8217;s actions are intentionally criminal or dangerously negligent, an admission of guilt is never something that will simply arrive on your desk. As soon as the individual or individuals in question sense that they are under the microscope, in all likelihood they will quickly rally to cover their tracks. This makes overt corporate investigations a risky pursuit, as HR quickly find themselves running up against dead ends, unable to pinpoint the source of accumulated losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In contrast, a covert investigation undertaken with the assistance of undercover investigations specialists from Lauth Investigations International ensures the means to cast a spotlight on the facts before they move forever into the shadows. Whether the result is confirmation of your fears and the opportunity to correct them justly, or the confidence that trust in your team is something that you can afford to indulge, undercover investigations provide ultimate peace of mind. If faith has been compromised at your workplace and you suspect that all is not as it should be, <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/contact-lauth-investigations\/\">reach out to our team today<\/a> for tailored advice on the best way to proceed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Inevitably, certain types of workplace wrongdoing warrant an overt investigation\u2014when it&#8217;s in the company&#8217;s best interests to take a stance of transparency when taking steps to rectify the issue at hand.
