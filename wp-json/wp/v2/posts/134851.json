It makes sense that investing in dedicated employees who ensure that the caliber of your recruitment and training initiatives remain gold standard is a solid choice. But when the time comes to conduct a pivotal HR investigation, it&#8217;s crucial to ask the question: is your human resources team as impartial as you need them to be to protect your best interests?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conducting corporate investigations often represents a minefield for leadership. Whether the issue on the table is <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/harassment-discrimination\/\">workplace harassment<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/fmla-investigations\/\">FMLA fraud<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/corporate-theft\/\">employee theft<\/a>, or any number of other unwelcome occurrences, the steps you take next hold the power to elevate or undo your company&#8217;s standing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, one misstep can set a course for litigation in relation to unfair dismissal or retaliation. If the current unfolding crisis is destined to lead you and your interests into the courtroom, even the faintest whiff of a lack of objectivity may well be your undoing. So lets look at the questions that you must ask yourself before leaving delicate matters in the sole hands of your HR team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Objective Are Your HR Staff Really?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When various departments share a single workplace, or even encounter each other on training and team-building days, bonds can be formed that might later cloud judgment and manifest as bias. What might that bias look like? Let&#8217;s explore some examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Confirmation Bias<\/strong><br>When your HR team has pre-formed beliefs about those they need to investigate\u2014as is often the case when relationships have been formed\u2014they may be prone to ignore crucial information that does not fit with what they believe to be true, and more likely to cherry-pick information that supports that bias.<\/li><li><strong>Bandwagon Bias<\/strong><br>Sometimes also referred to as in-group bias, this tendency results in co-workers adopting an \u201cus versus the world\u201d mentality that result in favorable perception of those within the group and adoption of dominant shared beliefs or statements whether correct or not.<\/li><li><strong>Halo Effect Bias<\/strong><br>The halo effect is often seen following a bad hire, making it a risk-factor within any HR department. In these instances, positive traits become the defining factor of an individual and overshadow clear evidence of wrongdoing on their part.<\/li><li><strong>Anchoring Bias<\/strong><br>This common form of cognitive bias sees untrained HR investigators become anchored to a conclusion that evidence gathered early in the investigation seemed to justify, and the inability to pivot towards a more accurate conclusion as more facts are presented.<\/li><li><strong>Status Quo Bias<br><\/strong>When an HR department looses its capacity to function dynamically with stale systems becoming habitually ingrained, status quo bias can manifest as resistance to the change that a critical HR investigation may warrant. The results of this unintentional negligence can be catastrophic as a dangerous course is continually justified.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Only One Chance to Get This Right<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An HR investigation is a serious undertaking, and while training a team to handle such matters can be strategically advantageous, so too can be bringing in a skilled external corporate investigator to ensure that objectivity always remains intact.
