One of the biggest risks comes from within the company itself. These are called insider threats, and&nbsp; when employees or other trusted people inside a company do things that harm the business. These actions can be stealing secrets, damaging property, or even leaking important information. This blog will explain how companies can use corporate investigations to protect themselves from insider threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-insider-threats\"><strong>What Are Insider Threats?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Insider threats are actions taken by people inside a company that can harm the business. These people can be employees, contractors, or even business partners. Sometimes, they do these harmful things on purpose. Other times, they do it by accident, but the results can be just as damaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a worker might accidentally share a company\u2019s secret information with the wrong person. In another case, an employee might purposely steal customer data to sell it to someone else. Both of these are insider threats, even though one was an accident and the other was on purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-are-insider-threats-dangerous\"><strong>Why Are Insider Threats Dangerous?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Insider threats are dangerous because the people inside a company already have access to important information. They know the company\u2019s secrets, systems, and weaknesses. Because of this, they can cause more harm than someone from the outside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine if a worker who knows all the passwords to the company\u2019s computer system decided to share them with someone else. This could allow a hacker to get into the company\u2019s system and steal important data. Because the worker had inside access, the hacker&#8217;s job becomes much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-common-types-of-insider-threats\"><strong>Common Types of Insider Threats<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXdz7qtZDbQjoHvdJnDzpXcIKWBYWWgQ5sPPR05cl2wd2bz_vgxfSesLGmZIXKlA-vQBcu5YEopQP1lC1UAXuHgtaBPtd8uELUqG1QsxtsAI8Ac6fO-ovFEOmJzYqXd9PrFoUjVK8DBXElwzzaBxkOMt6kNTmtEr4yI46uL_DrXcW0MoG27TSw?key=gW9ZBATFPoJlwf51PL2wSg\" alt=\"\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different types of insider threats, and it&#8217;s important to understand each one so companies can protect themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Malicious Insiders<\/strong>: These are people who intentionally want to harm the company. They might be upset with their job, want revenge, or want to make money by selling company secrets. These insiders are very dangerous because they know the company well and can plan their attacks carefully.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Careless Insiders<\/strong>: Sometimes, insiders do not mean to cause harm, but they do so by being careless. For example, an employee might accidentally click on a phishing email that gives hackers access to the company&#8217;s data. Even though the employee did not mean to do harm, the results can be just as bad as if they did.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Third-Party Insiders<\/strong>: These are people who work with the company but are not direct employees. For example, a contractor might have access to the company\u2019s systems and accidentally leak important information. Because they are not full-time employees, they might not follow the same security rules, making them a potential threat.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-corporate-investigations-help\"><strong>How Corporate Investigations Help?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate investigations are a way for companies to protect themselves from insider threats. These investigations involve looking closely at what is happening inside the company to find any problems or risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investigators might look at things like emails, computer files, and even security camera footage. They do this to find out if anyone is doing something that could harm the company. If they find a problem, they can work to fix it before it gets worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-steps-in-a-corporate-investigation\"><strong>Steps in a Corporate Investigation<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several steps involved in a corporate investigation. These steps help ensure that the investigation is thorough and finds any potential insider threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Identifying the Problem<\/strong>: The first step is to figure out what the problem is. This could be a missing file, strange behavior from an employee, or a security breach. Identifying the problem early is important because it allows the investigation to focus on the right areas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gathering Evidence<\/strong>: After identifying the problem, the next step is to gather evidence. This could include looking at emails, checking computer logs, and interviewing employees. The goal is to find proof of what is happening so that the company can take action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Analyzing the Evidence<\/strong>: Once the evidence is gathered, it needs to be analyzed. This means looking closely at the data to find patterns or signs of wrongdoing. For example, if an employee is sending a lot of emails to a competitor, this could be a sign that they are leaking information.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Taking Action<\/strong>: After the evidence has been analyzed, the company can take action. This might mean firing an employee, changing security protocols, or even involving law enforcement if the situation is serious. The goal is to stop the insider threat before it can cause more harm.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Preventing Future Threats<\/strong>: The final step is to put measures in place to prevent future insider threats. This could include better training for employees, stronger security systems, or regular checks to ensure everything is running smoothly.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-role-of-technology-in-corporate-investigations\"><strong>The Role of Technology in Corporate Investigations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology plays a big role in corporate investigations. With the help of advanced tools, companies can monitor their systems more closely and detect insider threats more quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXfnDlAXjyYGt80JhqBLMSOODlFsOpk26iLyOhWedmx0Fc0pQ0i3GA-bEgYHyz6I1Drj2DdDGD3c-lozqX1TSmiWgZ5OKaIompra7WB--2QZXZrLuu0Fs0BmiK956TRwyUi3BjqfZ15L4ZXQUpLMLbAqQQhqwF4EKPngC-Dnp7dtWnr_kSl3Rw?key=gW9ZBATFPoJlwf51PL2wSg\" alt=\"\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, many companies use software that can track employee activity on company computers. This software can alert the company if an employee is doing something suspicious, like trying to access files they shouldn\u2019t. This early warning system can help prevent insider threats before they cause any damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-case-studies-real-life-examples-of-insider-threats\"><strong>Case Studies: Real-Life Examples of Insider Threats<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how serious insider threats can be, let&#8217;s look at some real-life examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Edward Snowden Case<\/strong>: Edward Snowden was a contractor for the U.S. government who leaked classified information. He had access to important files and used that access to share secrets with the public. This case shows how dangerous insider threats can be when someone with inside knowledge decides to act against the organization.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Coca-Cola Recipe Theft Attempt<\/strong>: In 2006, an employee at Coca-Cola tried to steal the secret recipe for Coca-Cola and sell it to Pepsi. Pepsi reported the attempt to Coca-Cola, and the employee was caught. This case highlights how insider threats can be driven by greed and how they can be stopped with the right measures in place.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Target Data Breach<\/strong>: In 2013, hackers stole credit card information from millions of Target customers. The hackers gained access to Target\u2019s systems through a third-party contractor. This case shows how third-party insiders can pose a threat, even if they do not work directly for the company.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-best-practices-for-preventing-insider-threats\"><strong>Best Practices for Preventing Insider Threats<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Preventing insider threats requires a proactive approach. Here are some best practices that companies can follow to protect themselves:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Conduct Regular Employee Training<\/strong>: Employees should be trained on how to recognize and avoid insider threats. This includes being aware of phishing emails, securing their workstations, and following company security policies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Implement Strong Access Controls<\/strong>: Not everyone in the company needs access to all information. By limiting access to only those who need it, companies can reduce the risk of insider threats.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Monitor Employee Activity<\/strong>: Regularly monitoring employee activity can help catch suspicious behavior early. This could include checking email usage, reviewing access logs, and keeping an eye on file transfers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use Technology Wisely<\/strong>: Implementing the right technology can help companies detect and prevent insider threats. This could include security software, encryption tools, and regular system audits.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Foster a Positive Work Environment<\/strong>: A happy and engaged workforce is less likely to become a source of insider threats. Companies should work to create a positive work environment where employees feel valued and heard.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Insider threats are a serious risk for any company. Because these threats come from within, they can be more difficult to detect and prevent. However, with the right strategies, including corporate investigations, companies can protect themselves. By being proactive, using technology, and following best practices, businesses can reduce the risk of insider threats and keep their operations safe.If you suspect an insider threat or need help with a corporate investigation, contact <a href=\"hirelauth@lauthinvestigations.com\">Lauth Investigations International today<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In today&#8217;s world, companies face many risks.
