Just to name a few avenues, this occurs through operations, interpersonal relationships between employees, and a level of engagement from leadership that requires consistent enforcement of their established mission and values. Because a corporation\u2019s internal culture often remains hidden from consumer view, it\u2019s not uncommon for leadership to simply restructure operations. Unfortunately, if every aspect of a company\u2019s culture is not examined, this solution is just a band aid.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Ice Berg Metaphor&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When concerning a corporation\u2019s culture, we often use the iceberg metaphor as a means of defining it. Ten percent of a corporation\u2019s values and culture are above the water where the public and consumers can see it, and the other 90% lies below the surface. It\u2019s that 90% that directly affects a company\u2019s employee morale, productivity, and bottom line. A corporation often places its highest priority on how they are perceived by their consumer base, and therefore that 90% of company culture and values are either placed on the back burner, or corporations find themselves at a complete loss of how to get in front of the issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/yUSpxA3dxeRKjWSbagr76oA5xkB_ps2bot6ywGw3GsAVxe_eXJIgfjjkVZL9EUXb5ERquOjmFyO9MdxaOnzO-bO8liO0TtW9MEKvpHhkuDd2ji5n_Z6uSFb74Y4_F_u1a-ca08pOwqzZdPjD1g\" alt=\"\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"lazyload\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/bankrupt-j-c-penney-faces-164717500.html\">The reason restructuring internally does not improve a company\u2019s culture in the long-term<\/a> is because the effects of a company\u2019s culture are cyclical, and have nothing to do with the chain of command or employee hierarchy. The graphic above illustrates how a healthy company culture <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/8-signs-of-employee-apathy\/\">affects a company\u2019s day-to-day operations<\/a>:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Happy Employees&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other band aid fixes for happy employees include things like discounted vending machines in the breakrooms, or regular celebrations of major holidays and birthdays. These lovely notions might improve culture for a day or even a week, but the pervasive internal problems will remain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Engagement&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy employees are engaged employees. When a corporation\u2019s culture is healthy, employees feel invested in the success of their companies. The company\u2019s success becomes internalized as their own success, and they are more likely to be plugged in, to take initiative, and to think outside of the box when it comes to problem-solving.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved Operations&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When employees are leaning into their positions and actively working towards a company\u2019s goals, that leads to smoother daily operations. Engaged employees are constantly finding ways to improve their processes so they can generate higher rates of productivity within their positions&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Productivity&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When daily operations are streamlined, this yields higher levels of productivity within the company. An employee\u2019s daily duties are no longer a monotonous checklist, but a recipe for success for their company. An engaged employee\u2019s success is the success of everyone in the corporation, and the same is true of productivity. A single employee\u2019s increased productivity is the entire company\u2019s success. Not only does this set an example for all employees, but increased productivity is what helps a company grow, mature, and prosper.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Happy Leadership&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is a no-brainer. Anyone who has ever been employed knows that a happy boss makes a happy employee. Leadership sees the increase in engagement and productivity and lean into that success. Good leadership will reward that success in tangible ways that will have long-term effects on the company\u2019s culture. They promote or give raises to those employees who are giving 100%, empower those employees through collaboration and development, and are more open to the thoughts and ideas of employees who are contributing to their success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Morale&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When leadership is actively encouraging employees through a pure manifestation of the company\u2019s mission and values, employees feel as if they are making a difference within their organization. This increases the feeling of purpose and desire for cooperative teamwork. These feelings inspire employees to continue their pattern of success through the diligent, genuine practice of a company\u2019s established mission and values. Increased morale means happy employees, and that\u2019s where the cycle begins anew, exponentially influencing a company\u2019s success with each cycle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Structure is Not Culture&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The network of operations within a company will never have a direct effect on company morale. Poor daily operations due to structure are really just a symptom of unhealthy corporate culture\u2014a manifestation of poor culture at work. To diagnose the problem, many corporations turn to independent firms to conduct <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/06\/does-your-corporation-need-a-culture-audit\/\">corporate culture audits<\/a> in order to identify the problems within a company or organization. These firms measure a company\u2019s daily operations, their quality of communication, and interpersonal relations among employees\u2014just to name a few factors. When a corporate culture audit is comprehensive and curtailed to the organization, the findings can be invaluable to leadership that seeks to grow and mature in tandem with their values.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">To Review&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;As mentioned above, employees who see a consistent display of established values from leadership, they\u2019re more engaged and productive. It\u2019s one thing to have the company\u2019s mission statement and list of values posted online or on the wall within a workplace. It\u2019s a completely different ballgame when leadership puts their money where their mouth is, and serves as an example for the entire workforce. That example can have a ripple effect creating an interpersonal trust between employees, in which they all feel like they\u2019re on a team, working towards the same goal. It is in the nucleus of that atmosphere where real change and growth begin.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The biggest mistake executives make when trying to improve their corporate culture\u2026 The corporate culture within any company, without question, effects their bottom-line day to day.
