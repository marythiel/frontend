When executed correctly, company culture aligns&nbsp;the company&#8217;s mission, vision, values, and goals. It is no longer a secret that when employees are happy, they become more productive, and the workplace will likely achieve outstanding success.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most employees consider a positive company culture highly instrumental to business success. According to Deloitte&#8217;s research, an estimated 94% of executives and 88% of employees think a positive and distinct company culture is essential for business success. This is probably because a positive company culture has a way of increasing employee engagement. In addition, a positive corporate culture attracts and retains talented employees committed to working hard to help it achieve its short and long-term objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many managers and business owners may already know the importance of a great corporate culture. But the big question is; Do they know how to create a work environment where employees want to stay? A great way to start as a manager is by implementing fantastic benefits that improve workplace culture. Here are some of the benefits that can help turn your workplace into a positive and thriving environment;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage physical activity&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can help improve your workplace culture by encouraging your employees to be more physically active. Nowadays, the importance of a healthy lifestyle can never be overemphasized. It prevents diseases and keeps people fit, improving their moods and self-esteem. In addition, regular physical activity can improve energy levels and concentration, making your employees excel according to their full potential. Physical activity can also reduce stress, anxiety, and depression among your employees. A healthier workforce can lead to lower healthcare costs and lower absenteeism rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, however, several ways of encouraging your employees to be physically active. For example, you could provide a well-equipped on-site gym for them, allowing them to exercise after working hours or on weekends. Alternatively, you could subsidize gym membership to encourage them to register at off-site gyms. Also, as a manager, you could start a company&#8217;s sports team or encourage your employees to participate in group fitness classes. Whatever you do, make sure there are options for everyone to find an activity that works for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offer flexible work hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A company that offers flexible work hours has a way of motivating its employees to be highly productive. The significant advantage of providing your employees flexible work hours is that it gives them the freedom to work when they are most effective. For example, with flexible work hours, employees who are more productive in the mornings can work morning shifts, while those more productive later in the day can work afternoon shifts. As a result, flexible work hours improve work\/life balance and increase job satisfaction. It can also help attract and retain top talent.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help implementing flexible work hours, you can always start by surveying your employees to see what would work best for them. In addition, you could also offer a trial period to see how it works before making any permanent changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide free or discounted meals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free or discounted meals are a great way to show your employees that you appreciate and care about their wellbeing. Besides, providing your employees with free or discounted meals will also help them save money and time. For example, if you offer them free meals during lunch, they may not have any reason to commute to other parts of the city to have lunch during breaks. Also, they get to save money they would have otherwise used to buy their meals. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, one of the best ways to provide free or discounted meals to your employees is to partner with a local restaurant or a catering company. You could also set up a lunchroom in the office with equipment such as a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Whatever you do, ensure that the options guarantee healthy eating habits for your employees.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offer paid time off for volunteering.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a manager, you could also improve your workplace culture by encouraging employees to give back to their communities. The best way to achieve this is by offering them paid time off for volunteering. Paid time off for volunteering shows employees that you value their time and commitment to making a difference in their communities. Moreover, it&#8217;s also a great way to build team morale and camaraderie.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, to offer paid time off for volunteering, start by partnering with a nonprofit. You could also encourage employees to volunteer for company-sponsored events. Whatever you do, give your employees notice so they can plan their time off accordingly.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to your workplace culture, the costs associated with offering employees a better quality of life while on your team can be far less than the costs associated with turnover. Employee retention goes up and happy employees yield a higher level of output than employees who are dissatisfied with their work-life balance. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Workplace culture is crucial to a company\u2019s success.&nbsp;The culture is what determines how employees within the organization behave.
