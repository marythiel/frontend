While exact definitions may differ, a corporate crisis is generally defined as \u201can event, situation, or public initiative that threatens the\u00a0company&#8217;s\u00a0ability to effectively operate its business. A\u00a0crisis\u00a0can escalate into a disaster or long-term impediment to business growth if not handled with efficiency and sensitivity to all involved.\u201d This is a large umbrella that encompasses many of the internal issues we associate with companies, including (but not limited to) fraud, theft, misconduct, and harassment of all kinds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A majority of corporate crises fall into one of three categories: personnel, systemic, and contextual. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <strong>personnel crisis<\/strong> is an internal issue that is a direct result of an individual employee or a group of employees\u2019 bad behavior. Theft by personnel is one of the most widely-reported crises in corporations throughout America. The scope of this problem can be as small as stealing office supplies all the way up to executive embezzlement. Sexual harassment is a type of personnel crisis receiving a welcomed new level of attention in corporations. In the age of the #MeToo movement, corporations are viewing their workforce very differently when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2018\/10\/investigating-employee-misconduct\/\">identifying potential predators<\/a> in their midst in the name of a \u201cpound of cure.\u201d Prudent steps taken when vetting potential hires and current employees has saved companies difficulties down the line, especially in legal fees and public relations.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><\/span><\/li>\n<li>A <strong>systemic crisis<\/strong> refers to a major breakdown in operations negatively impacting business. A common example is food service corporations that receive a sudden influx of food poisoning complaints. Source of the outbreak may be traced back to how the supplier or distributor handled the food product, and suddenly, there\u2019s a systemic crisis: A misstep in operations led to a large sum of incidents. Systemic problems manifest themselves in many forms, including <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/01\/line-exposing-theft-manufacturing\/\">external theft<\/a>. Repeated theft, both in <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2014\/09\/private-investigation-celebrity-cyber-hackers\/\">cyberspace <\/a>and the real world, is often the result of insufficient security within a company. Consequently, the company incurs loss because they remain vulnerable. Companies who have chronic turnover due to employee misconduct may have flaws in their vetting system for potential employees. That is another example of a crucial operation where a breakdown occurs and erodes a company\u2019s profits with labor hours to hire a new individual to fill a vacant position.<\/li>\n<li>A <strong>contextual crisis<\/strong> has exponential consequences for a business relative to its size. These are the types of crises that companies cannot anticipate, because they influence public perception of their brand based on real-life events. A major news story like a mass shooting, or a major criminal case, or a lawsuit, can negatively impact a brand even if that event is not directly associated with that company. These external events can drastically change a company\u2019s internal operations, and can weigh heavy on employees at every level. <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2019\/02\/private-investigators-sexual-abuse-investigations\/\">Sexual harassment<\/a> is another example of this type of crisis in motion. The media coverage regarding high-level Hollywood executives like Harvey Weinstein and his alleged history of abuse have executives in companies of all shapes and sizes revisiting their human resource policies and practices when it comes to addressing sexual misconduct in the workplace. Internal operations receive a major overhaul to the benefit of a healthier work environment for everyone.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to corporate crises, not all businesses will be able to afford specialized investigators to work in-house to resolve issues that arise. Even if they can afford these professionals, investigators employed by the company\u2014regardless of the quality of their work\u2014by definition cannot provide a truly objective solution to any problem. Because they\u2019re employed by the corporation, they have a potential stake in the outcome of the investigation, whether that stake be real or perceived. Hiring an independent professional, <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\/2018\/07\/5-ways-private-investigators-benefit-human-resources\/\">like a licensed private investigator<\/a>, to conduct an external investigation is the best way to ensure that the solution is objective. This is particularly important personnel crises, because terminating personnel based on an unbiased investigation is kerosene for a disgruntled employee that can manifest itself with many devastating consequences\u2014most commonly wrongful termination lawsuits. Private investigators can assist in systemic crises as well, like the example of repeated thefts with regards to security. Private investigators who specialize in different kinds of risk assessment can identify a company\u2019s vulnerabilities to thieves and scammers, and provide them with a game plan to improve their security. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business has encountered a corporate crisis, call <a href=\"https:\/\/lauthinveststg.wpengine.com\">Lauth Investigations International <\/a>today for a free consultation.
