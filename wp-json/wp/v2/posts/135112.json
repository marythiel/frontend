Vince MacMahon, the man whose name is synonymous with the professional wrestling world, has finally retired from the world of what he calls \u201csports entertainment.\u201d However, after a checkered history in front of the camera as a fictionalized version of himself and behind the scenes as the WWE\u2019s CEO and creative director, those working in the WWE have reported a \u2018night and day\u2019 change in the federation following the exit of Vince MacMahon. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since taking over the business from his father, Vince MacMahon has been largely credited with uniting the professional wrestling world by buying up competing factions of wrestlers throughout the United States and merging them under one banner, what we know today as the WWE. In 2021 alone, the WWE reported more than $1 billion in revenue in their fourth quarter report. At the age of 76, MacMahon announced his impending retirement on July 22 in the wake of a report released by the Wall Street Journal that he had made over $14.6 million in hush money to various women to quell allegations of sexual misconduct. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following his retirement from the WWE, MacMahon\u2019s daughter, Stephanie MacMahon has been named chairwoman of the company, becoming a co-CEO alongside Nick Kahn, the former head of CAA\u2019s television department. Stephanie MacMahon\u2019s husband, Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque, who rose to wrestling fame in the 1990s, will now be in charge of talent relations and creative\u2014a position previously heavily supervised by Vince MacMahon himself. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change in leadership is already showing signs of strengthening the company\u2019s corporate culture where it was previously buckling amidst MacMahon\u2019s reported misconduct. According to Mike Johnson from the PWInsider, \u201cOne department where that change has been described as \u2018massively night and day\u2019 has been inside the company\u2019s production end&#8230;there isn\u2019t anyone yelling at the production truck or the announcers anymore since Vince MacMahon, who was extremely heavy-handed verbally over the course of TV productions, is no longer here.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since MacMahon\u2019s departure more than a month ago, there have been reports of a dramatic uptick in morale throughout the WWE, with the work environment being characterized as less hostile. The feeling of \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d has disapated with at least one production employee reporting that the change in leadership has \u201callowed them to \u2018feel like it\u2019s fun to work here.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As part of an ongoing series, Lauth Investigations International is highlighting how poor corporate culture in professional sports starts at the top, and how changes in leadership can change an organization for years to come. \u00a0 Vince MacMahon The world of wrestling has changed significantly for the first time in nearly 40 years.
