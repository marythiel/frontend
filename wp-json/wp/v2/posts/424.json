While a business deal may seem lucrative and advantageous on the surface, complex and devastating problems could be lurking below the surface. By determining a potential company\u2019s background and assets, you will be preventing business disasters by determining the factual background of a company as well as lowering the risk of crime within the business.<\/p>\n<p>While Michael Sisco may be describing due diligence as related to technology, he still has several key concepts that every business may consider which follow as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stability<\/li>\n<li>Financial cost trends<\/li>\n<li>Individual &#8220;flight risks&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Business continuity issues<\/li>\n<li>Key players (2)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What exactly is involved in the due diligence process? First of all, a confidentiality agreement is requested from the seller by the buyer. This is basically an agreement to gain the knowledge about EVERY aspect of the business before you make an agreement with the seller. If you do not make an offer in the end, this agreement ensures you will keep all information confidential. The following is a list of items that are typical in a confidentiality agreement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Financials&#8211;3 years of financials is typical<\/li>\n<li>Employees&#8211;title, wage, duties<\/li>\n<li>Vendors\u2014relationship with company<\/li>\n<li>Inventory<\/li>\n<li>Equipment<\/li>\n<li>Furniture and fixtures<\/li>\n<li>Debts\u2014It is vital you understand if you are acquiring any debt, and if so, how much<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Due diligence also involves a review period, which can be agreed upon, and three critical issues are explored during this time period. Legal due diligence is important to determine if the seller has the title to sell the company which is essential if the seller is part of a franchise. The financial due diligence portion can determine if there are hidden assets or financial issues that need to be addressed. Commercial due diligence will determine the competition of the business as well as how the market views the business. If everything goes well and you decide to buy the business, consult someone to write a buy\/sell agreement. (3)<\/p>\n<p>Other key ideas to keep in mind: &#8220;Capital\u2014If you have leftover capital, use it wisely, and don\u2019t overspend. Employees\u2014Review all employees again. Fire the ones that have red flags or hire new ones if they current employees are doing their job. Inventory and Equipment\u2014Be frugal. Upgrade instead of buy brand new equipment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind to not rely on verbal statements. Stick to the confidentiality agreement. If the seller is not divulging all information, there is probably a (shady) reason so look into a new seller. Do not try to conduct due diligence on your own, and do not neglect the due diligence process. It could end in disaster. (3)<\/p>\n<p>The lack of due diligence can have significant unforeseen financial consequences. For example, the Victorian Funds Management Corporation lost $500 million dollars due to lack of due diligence and relied only on Google searches. Their choice in pursuing death funds by Life Settlements Whole Funds turned out to be a financial disaster. Instead of taking the time to properly check out the deal and listen to regulators who cautioned against it, they went through with the merger. If they would have performed due diligence, they would not have been discredited or have suffered such a substantial financial setback. (4)<\/p>\n<p>Remember, when you merge with another company or acquire their company, THEIR problems become YOUR problems. These problems can be as minor as inflated labor costs or as disastrous as embezzling corporate funding. The solution to this potential risk is to ensure you conduct proper due diligence before you partner with another company. You wouldn\u2019t want their mistakes to become the failure of your company. The positive aspect is that by acquiring or merging with another company can lead to more success for your business if the background check is conducted properly.<\/p>\n<p><i>About the Author: Kym L.
