<p>It is intimidating when an employee hears that they are being investigated. This activity should follow due-process, following established procedures that ensure fairness for all parties involved. Employee investigation is a paramount aspect of maintaining a healthy and productive workforce. Investigations are conducted to unearth several issues, such as discrimination, harassment, theft, fraud, and violation of company policies.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>However, following the ethical and legal issues inherent to investigations requires best practice. In this article, we shall explore the complexities surrounding workplace investigations and the ethical and legal challenges the organizations face, and provide insight into possible ways of dealing with these hurdles.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Importance of Employee Investigations</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Although perceived as an intrusive method, employee investigation is vital for an organization to safeguard the integrity, employees&#8217; rights, and ensure fairness and equality. According to a survey by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, organizations lose about 5% of their annual revenue to fraud and theft, underscoring the importance of conducting investigations. This data shows the financial impact that employee misconduct can have on the business, which is why a thorough investigation is needed to mitigate such risks. Our genealogical investigation services focus primarily on proving familial relationships and heirship through documentation in matters of estate, probate, or other financial circumstances, which gives you a chance to partner with us.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Legal Considerations</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Investigation of employees require planning. There is a legal framework under which it should be conducted to ensure compliance, fairness, and protection of employees&#8217; rights. We don&#8217;t anticipate scenarios where a human resource director just set up an employee for investigation due to personal issues of their own. Failure to navigate this legal pitfall exposes an organization to legal battles and possible reputational damage.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>One critical legal consideration is sustaining confidentiality during the process of investigation. Since investigators access huge tracts of data both for organization and employees, protecting this sensitive information and respecting privacy are essential. A breach of confidentiality can result in lawsuits concerning privacy. Have a confidentiality policy emphasizing protecting sensitive information during employee investigation.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Another important consideration is that any employee&#8217;s investigation process should be impartial and prompt. Discrimination against an employee included in the investigation is a violation which is punishable within the local laws, and can result in negative consequences for an organization. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission highlighted that discrimination and retaliation charges accounted for 55.8% of all charges reported in the year 2023, underscoring the importance of fairness throughout the investigation process.</p>

<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ethical Dilemmas</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Investigation of employees faces ethical dilemmas, which an organization must deal with. One such dilemma is ensuring transparency while simultaneously wanting to protect the confidentiality of information. It is within workers&#8217; rights to know the outcome of the investigation to which they have been subjected, but disclosing the affected person&#8217;s information compromises their privacy. This is a skinny rope to tread on, and having the right advice from experts such as Lauth&#8217;s legal team would expose you to boundaries beyond which you cannot pass.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Another ethical dilemma is ensuring that investigations are conducted in an unbiased manner. This requires engaging investigators who are trained to remain neutral and objective to the core duty. However, unconscious bias can still influence the decision, resulting in an unfair outcome. Diversity and inclusion training would lessen the biases of investigators.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Practices for Navigating Legal and Ethical Challenges</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>To effectively deal with the problem of legal and ethical difficulties in employee investigations, the following best practices can be adopted by your organization:</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:list -->
<ul><!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>Develop a comprehensive guideline of how the investigation should be done, detailing the requirements for every step.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item -->

<!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>Train the investigators on legal requirements, interviewing techniques, and ethical standards.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item -->

<!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>Maintain the confidentiality of all information of the involved parties and refrain from discussing the outcome of the investigation with the unapproved person.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item -->

<!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>Communicate the process and outcome of the investigation to employees to cultivate trust.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item -->

<!-- divi:list-item -->
<li>After the conclusion of the investigation, follow up with the necessary disciplinary action required, and implement corrective measures to prevent a recurrence.</li>
<!-- /divi:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /divi:list -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Employee investigation is a complex process that requires careful consideration of legal and ethical obligations. However, ensuring fairness and transparency in this process helps an organization achieve the intended objective, thus raising a culture of accountability. Through proactive measures and a commitment to ethical conduct, organizations can safeguard their reputation, protect employees&#8217; rights, and maintain trust and credibility.</p>

<p>Picture this: a workplace where employees feel respected, safe, and valued. Sounds good, right! Unfortunately, this is not always an ideal situation. The study by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revealed that workplace violence affects about 2 million people every year in the United States alone. These figures may be scary and mitigate your determination to conduct business. Fear not, as there are well-proven strategies that you can implement to safeguard your employees and organization. This article will discuss five effective methods to create a working environment where safety reigns supreme.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Comprehensive Prevention Policy</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine a castle without robust walls; it will be prone to attacks. Similarly, the organization and employees are at risk without a workable prevention policy in the workplace. Policies are internally created and customized to fit the nature of your business. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all policies, as different organizations engage in activities with varied levels of risk. Studies have shown that workplaces with clear violence policies report lower incidences. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine indicates that companies with violence policies experience 40% fewer cases than those without such guidelines.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The policy should define terms such as harassment, verbal abuse, and physical violence, which employees experience in the workplace. Notably, this policy document should also clearly indicate the reporting procedure, the disciplinary action to be taken, and the supportive mechanism for the victims. While some human resource directors might consider this a lot of work, it improves productivity. We, as Lauth, will conduct a proper violence assessment to give you insight into how well-prepared you are for incidences of violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Training and Creating Awareness among the Employees</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is self-fulfilling for a business owner to have a vigilant team that can detect threats. Employee training equips them with the necessary skills, such as interpersonal skills and conflict management, which makes them handle issues that could result in violence. The leading cause of violence within the workplace is a lack of understanding among the workforce, and appreciating diversity lessens violence. Investing in training saves time that could have been used to solve the conflict. For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) study showed that companies that invested in workplace violence training experienced a 70% reduction in workplace violence. Arm your team with knowledge!</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting Rigorous Risk Assessment</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps you cannot perceive the inherent risk that violence can bring to your business because it has never happened. Or better put, take into consideration an employee who gets injured while at work due to an incidence of violence, such as a physical altercation. Picture that regarding litigations related to work injury benefit claims, and I am sure you will appreciate the need to fortify your defense. A regular risk assessment identifies the vulnerabilities within your business. Through our experienced risk assessment investigator, we identify weak points in your system and provide a comprehensive report on improvements.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing Workplace Violence Prevention Teams</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Having a dedicated team of guardians for preventing workplace violence is the best thing you can gift your business this year. This team is instrumental in ensuring petty issues resulting from violence are handled out immediately before they escalate. A small problem, such as miscommunication, can snowball into physical or verbal abuse. It is prudent to establish a workplace violence prevention team consisting of experts from different departments, and their primary role would be to develop and implement violence prevention strategies.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:image {"id":165943,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="545" height="558" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2.png" alt="Proactive Strategies for Preventing Workplace Violence" class="wp-image-165943" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2.png 545w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Proactive2-480x491.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 545px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Organizations with a workable workplace violence prevention team are good at establishing potential threats before they happen. This is supported by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), which indicated that 80% of the companies with violence prevention teams reported a decrease in workplace violence incidences. As a starting point, develop a violence prevention team and track the cases within the first year. The outcome will be appealing, and for you to achieve this, we suggest helping you with a corporate culture audit to serve as a mirror of exactly how prepared you are in regard to workplace violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting a Culture of Respect and Support</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Build solidarity among your employees. Being united is a compact pillar in mitigating violence in the workplace. Successful organizations foster a culture of respect and support, which essentially prevents violence in the workforce. This is because the employees feel valued, and they tend to propagate the value of respect to the advantage of the business. How do you cultivate a culture of support and respect? This happens through encouraging open communication and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy for harassment or discrimination. These approaches create a sense of belonging, preventing conflict from escalating into violence.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is undeniably true that workplace violence impedes an organization&#8217;s growth and lowers productivity. As the workforce continues to become more diverse, the chances of conflicts, hence violence, would continue in the workplace. Therefore, it is wrong to sit and wait until an incident happens in order to act. This article has highlighted the different strategies you can adopt for your enterprise and stand out in averting the repercussions that tag along with violence. Lauth can help you with your violence assessment, risk assessment, and corporate audit to mitigate violence.</p>

<p>In the modern way of doing business, fostering a working environment of respect, inclusivity, and diversity is not only a requirement but a legal mandate. This has happened due to the changing market dynamics, where the world is now a global village. Interconnectedness has increased, and therefore, there is a need to enhance cultural respect. However, harassment and discrimination continue to be a pervasive issue, derailing the morale of the workers and also limiting organizational growth.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>To deal with these challenges effectively, an organization is supposed to employ proactive strategies that ensure equality and respect. The actionable steps discussed in this article would benefit a business that wants to avert the challenges of harassment and discrimination in the workplace and improve productivity.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the Latitude of the problem</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Before engaging ourselves in actual steps that can be used to deal with harassment and discrimination, it is paramount to understand the prevalence and impact of the issue. According to the report released by the Employment Opportunity Commission (EOC), it was noted that about 33% of the cases reported to them related to workplace harassment. It also informs that the highest form of discrimination is centered on race, gender, age, and disability.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>This shows a problem; we cannot hide our heads under the sand and assume everything is okay. Human resource directors have a role to play, especially in the present era, where penetration of technology has allowed a diverse workforce, which is a trigger to discrimination and harassment.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promoting Awareness through Training</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Employees might lack the proper knowledge regarding the harm they bring to an organization through discrimination and harassment. On equal measure, the executives charged with the mandates of upholding the company&#8217;s integrity might fail to comprehend how a simple act of favoritism has on corporate culture. This lack of information is what training on harassment and discrimination comes to fill.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The workforce is taught how to relate with each other and work as a team, and the overall impact on the organization&#8217;s success. The training can be executed through workshops and scenario-based simulations. In that regard, a human resource director needs to fully understand the nature of the culture in the workplace by conducting a corporate culture audit, a service well executed by Lauth&#8217;s team of experts. Our private investigators are trained to move unseen; therefore, the report you get reflects the actual situation of your workplace regarding harassment and discrimination.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="979" height="650" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/preventing2.png" alt="Preventing Workplace Harassment and Discrimination." class="wp-image-165937" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/preventing2.png 979w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/preventing2-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 979px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Clear Policies and Procedures</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Why do some workers face stressful levels of harassment and discrimination in the working environment with all levels of management? It is astonishing to note that even large multinationals have reported cases of discrimination and harassment. This, therefore, leaves us with the question of how the small and medium businesses are, where we expect the formality to be ignored. The single answer to this is the lack of an anti-harassment policy; if it is there, it is just a document to show compliance and is less discussed in departmental meetings.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Research by the International Labour Organization (ILO) established that companies with anti-harassment policies are more likely to effectively deal with issues of workplace harassment. This is because the policy defines the process of reporting, dealing with disciplinary cases, and handling the affected person. One of the examples where this policy has worked is at Walmart. The retailer strengthened its anti-harassment policy by enforcing zero-tolerance to harassment. We know the employees might fear reporting harassment and discrimination cases to human resource office. Lauth has a dedicated hotline that you can leverage, and we do the investigation work for you as you concentrate on other duties.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fostering a Culture of Accountability</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Leaders play a pivotal role in swaying the behavior of the workers. The manager, departmental heads, and those in supervisory roles are responsible for upholding the organizational culture, which sets the tone of acceptable behavior. As a human resource director, you are the organization&#8217;s engine, and the employees’ character dictates who you are. In that regard, holding yourself accountable for upholding positive values and inclusivity is beneficial. Set the agenda of zero discrimination or harassment in the workplace from day one when a new employee is hired. This would eventually cascade and be held as the culture of the organization.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>One way to ensure accountability is conducting a targeted recruitment. This involves assessing the workplace environment and identifying areas and unbalanced skills that need more stability. This would ensure that minority groups are included and expand the talent pool across. This has an overall effect of mitigating turnover and improving employees’ satisfaction.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Combating harassment and discrimination requires different approaches, as discussed above. Similarly, an organization must prioritize a culture of inclusivity and respect since it creates a supportive working environment. This means that the human resource department has a critical responsibility to understand the weaknesses and strengths in their culture to institute necessary remedies. Together, we contribute towards a working environment where every worker feels respected and valued.</p>

<p>Every decision carries a potential consequence. This statement is true even for organizations, and they have to be cautious in every process that constitutes operations. In today&#8217;s dynamic business landscape, digital technology is advancing, and businesses must take care of the risk inherent to hiring and vendor selection. To embrace diversity, enterprises are appreciating the role of cultural amalgamation, attracting people of different characters, skills and qualifications. This is where due diligence acts as a shield against unforeseen risks.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Risk management is elemental for organizations that want to progress in the evolving market environment. As such, the best way to lessen risks is to start from the bottom- understanding the nature of employees and vendors before they become part of your organization. We unveil the power of due diligence and why a human resource director should embrace it.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding Due Diligence</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Due diligence involves in-depth research and investigation, usually conducted by an organization, before agreeing with an employee or vendor. This is the most crucial stage for every organization, as it determines the efficiency of the contract entered into. This process is detailed and entails gathering information, analyzing the data, interpreting it, and verifying the information presented. As lengthy as it may appear, this is a very instrumental chain, as it guides informed decision-making, mitigating the risks. By conducting due diligence, parties&#8217; interests and any problem that can be experienced in the future are protected.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Imperative of Due Diligence in Hiring</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Why, then, is it essential to conduct due diligence in hiring? Statistics reveal that bad hires are a cost for any business. Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) noted that bad hires constitute about five times the position&#8217;s annual salary. This is mind-blowing to any human resource director tasked with ensuring the workforce is skilled enough to benefit the company. Through due diligence, it would be easier to mitigate the risk of bad hires. This cost is incurred in recruitment, training, lost productivity, and legal fees.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Also, conducting due diligence in hiring ensures regulatory compliance. It is equally a requirement for human resource directors to ensure that they comply with the employment local laws, regulations, and standards when hiring. We are in an era marked with stringent local rules regarding the employment process, and due diligence has become mandatory. Failing to understand the actual qualifications and credentials of the candidate can expose the company to legal battles and tarnish its reputation. For instance, hiring a candidate with a history of fraud or ethical delinquency in highly regulated industries such as finance and health care attracts fines or license revocation. Lauth&#8217;s investigative team can unearth the questionable background of your new hires to cut on this cost.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging Due Diligence in Vendor Selection</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Vendor services involve entrusting part of the business operations to an external entity, making the organization prone to fraud. One essential purpose of due diligence is to safeguard against these fraudulent activities. With a proper background check, an organization can avoid getting into the loop of deceptive vendors, which can compromise the supply chain&#8217;s integrity, and thus losing customer trust. A case in point is the Enron Scandal, where the failure of the company to conduct due diligence resulted in huge financial loss. Association with the fraudulent vendor contributed to financial loss and triggered corporate governance reforms globally. A simple step of ensuring you know your vendor can save your organization from such.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The primary duty of a vendor is to support an organization in running smoothly and ensuring efficiency. Due diligence evaluates the vendor&#8217;s financial stability and capability to take that role. We live when global economies are uncertain and market fluctuations are evident. Due diligence, therefore, gives an overview of the vendor&#8217;s financial health, risk exposure, and solvency to reduce the risk of disrupting the supply chain management.</p>

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Practices for Effective Due Diligence</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Embracing technology is the best way to remain ahead regarding due diligence and get the desired results. It is elemental for your organization to invest in modern technologies, such as the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics, to uncover facts that manual operation cannot. Also, this should be coupled with collaboration and information sharing. Collaborating with peer industries, regulatory bodies, and professional bodies can allow access to databases to learn more about the candidates. One such valuable entity is Lauth, and we pride ourselves on using verified databases to secure a comprehensive background report on the relevant Subjects in the case.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>That said, due diligence is not a one-time thing. An organization should implement systems for continuous monitoring. This is because information is not static, and the vendor&#8217;s details might change along the way. Thus, it is essential to keep track of records to adapt to evolving risks.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Risk prowls at every corner, and the beacon of assurance that organizations can rely upon is conducting due diligence. Whether during the hiring process or selecting a vendor, due diligence remains the pillar of hope, safeguarding the organization&#8217;s reputation and interest. Embracing these due diligence principles and integrating them into decision-making gives an organization the resilience and confidence to navigate turbulent waters. Don&#8217;t stress; our investigators have the necessary tool chest to conduct objective, covert undercover operations to unearth misconduct among the hires and vendors.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>In today&#8217;s hyperconnected world, safeguarding your business from pervasive workplace theft and fraud is inevitable, and demands a multifaceted approach. Enterprises are increasingly grappling with the metamorphosis of criminal tactics and the advancement of technology. These trends are a danger to any surviving business and require well-thought-out approaches to mitigate losses. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), organizations lose about 5% of their total revenue through fraud, which amounts to trillion dollars annually. This loss goes beyond financial, to damage of trust by customers, dented reputation, and legal ramifications.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure your workplace is protected from these threats, it is paramount to institute solid strategies that address vulnerabilities across the business- policies, employee awareness, organization culture, and policies. Let&#8217;s delve into methods that you can employ to prevent theft and fraud in your industry.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Culture of Integrity</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>It is essential to understand that a business is as good as its employees. This means that if the workforce is morally corrupted, this is reflected in your business, and the chances of making losses are high. Cultivating a culture of integrity is the foundation of dealing with fraud, and this has been supported by past research showing that institutions with high integrity culture experience less fraud. Does this resonate with you? Well, let&#8217;s look at the case of Wells Fargo, a financial institution embroiled in a scandal of fraudulent account openings. Due to the aggressive sales culture of the company, it incentivized employees to achieve unrealistic targets. This misconduct of wanting to achieve short-term gains damaged the company&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>A simple act of failing to act ethically can ruin your years of investment, a pitfall that businesses should avoid. This can happen by supporting workforce accountability, transparency, and honesty. As a human resource director, you are responsible for encouraging an open form of communication where employees can report any theft or fraudulent activities without fear. For you to effectively implement these, it is essential that you understand the nature of your corporate culture, and Lauth has seasoned experts in conducting corporate culture audits. We will ensure that the findings of the audit capture the weaknesses and provide workable recommendations.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting Thorough Background Checks</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Trust but verify.&#8221; This adage should prevail when hiring new employees. Conducting a thorough background check is vital in identifying the red flags and mitigating the risk. The data released by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) alludes that about one-third of job applicants provide false information on their resumes. This should scare you as a human resource director. Consider the Enron Energy Company case, deemed one of the heinous accounting frauds in history that led to its demise. If the company had conducted proper background checks on the executive, they might have uncovered the unethical behavior.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:image {"id":165934,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="908" height="438" src="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2.png" alt="Background checks at the workplace" class="wp-image-165934" srcset="https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2.png 908w, https://lauthinvestigations.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Safeguard2-480x232.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 908px, 100vw" /></figure>
<!-- /divi:image -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>The rule of thumb is a background check is essential to prevent internal fraud and theft, which could potentially cripple your business. Most human resource directors need to pay more attention to this stage, as it is perceived to waste time. It&#8217;s understandable, but we must find a way to dispel the fact that such a process can be outsourced. Our private investigators are experienced in conducting comprehensive background checks and providing objective details that would save your company in the future.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Stringent Access Controls</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>We must uphold the importance of securing business&#8217;s information and critical data. Insider threats account for a high percentage of fraud incidents, emphasizing the significance of having strong access control. To avoid data breaches, it is imperative to implement pin codes, biometric scanners, and keycards since they are important tools for identifying and monitoring the activities of employees within the place of work.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Are all these stringent measures effective? The answer to this question might differ depending on whether your business has experienced a case of fraud or theft. However, it has been proven that establishing access control at the cash office prevents theft. This is because all log trails are left behind, and any theft can be traced to a specific employee. You need to know the source to mitigate. That&#8217;s why the fraud investigation service is elemental for your company.</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Surveillance and Monitoring Systems</h2>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Deploying surveillance cameras and monitoring systems could be a step towards mitigating theft and fraud in the workplace. While it might intimidate the workers, it is a security awareness strategy. The study conducted by the University of North Carolina showed that cameras reduce theft and fraud by 51%. For example, in the retail sector, video analytics software can detect activities such as shoplifting and provide real-time information to security personnel to act. Now that our most excellent tool at Lauth is risk assessment, we can offer guidelines on where you could be missing regarding surveillance and monitoring. Secure your investment!</p>
<!-- /divi:paragraph -->

<!-- divi:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /divi:heading -->

<!-- divi:paragraph -->
<p>Safeguarding your business against theft and fraud needs a comprehensive approach, requiring you to examine your organization&#8217;s culture, existing policies, available technology, and employees&#8217; awareness. Organizations can curb theft and fraud by implementing a culture of integrity, conducting background checks, implementing access control, and ensuring surveillance and monitoring systems. These protect your reputation and assets and uphold the culture of accountability. Lauth&#8217;s investigative services chip in to supplement your organization’s operational safety.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Early in the process of starting her career here at Lauth Investigations, Valerie came across a claim for approximately $8,500 due to a man named Stephen. After finding the right contact information for him in North Carolina, Valerie called him on the phone. She revealed to him that the assets were from a Death Benefit that belonged to his father Louis, upon his passing.  Louis had passed away quite some time ago. Sometimes, these assets just get lost and forgotten about until our researchers are able to research and find them. </p>
<p>When asked if Lauth Investigations could assist him in getting this money recovered and back to him, Stephen replied, “Even if it were $25.00, I would want the money because I can sure use it”.  This was one of the first moments that Valerie realized the importance of what we do here at Lauth Investigations. We reunite people with what rightfully belongs to them, sometimes at a crossroads in their lives. If $25.00 could help him, think about the impact of the rest of the money, we would be able to return to him.  </p>
<p>While still learning the systems we use at Lauth: Return Assets, Valerie was quick to navigate the process. She learned about how to generate documents, write up the Intake Sheet, find obits, order Death Certificates, order Probate Records, and so much more. It was a real learning experience for Valerie, using many of the same processes she uses today. </p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Part of the process of proving a claim is not only proving your identity and heirship but also finding that you are the sole remaining heir. In the discovery process of this case, Valerie learned that there was one more potential heir. Stephen had a brother, Alex, who unfortunately passed away very young. Since he’s technically still an heir, Valerie had to prove that while he still was, his death nullified the payout. </p>
<p>Valerie was involved in the process of getting a death certificate of Alex, and through the discovery process, Stephen learned things about his brother’s passing that he didn’t know before, which gave him a sense of closure. Stephen was very appreciative throughout the process and was very helpful in providing the information to get this claim processed quickly. When asked about this case, Valerie was over the moon to have been a part of it from start to finish.   </p>
<p>Stories like these are a big reason why Lauth Investigations: Return Assets Division does what it does. We’re able to use our unique skillsets to help people get their assets returned to them. Not only did Stephen receive his payout (which he was able to use immediately), but he was able to find out more about the events that led to his brothers&#8217; passing when they were young. Stephen was very appreciative of his time working with Lauth, and we’re excited to continue this work. We’ve been able to return over $60 million dollars to people since our organization began and look forward to continuing to grow that number. </p></div>

<p>Back in September, the landscape of California workplaces was impacted dramatically upon Governor Gavin Newsom signing <a href="https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employment-law/its-such-a-broad-brush-californias-workplace-violence-prevention-law/463477">Senate Bill 533</a>, which requires that California employers now implement a detailed workplace violence prevention plan in compliance with their Cal/OHSA Injury Illness Prevention Plan. In addition to implementing a plan, employers must now ensure their workers have access to proper training on their plan and keep detailed records of any incidents of violence in the workplace. The law will take effect on July 1, 2024.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Role of Third-Party Investigators:</h2>



<p>With the advent of these violence prevention programs, there arises a critical need for thorough evaluations of current operations and workplaces. This is where third-party investigators come into play. These professionals bring a fresh and unbiased perspective to the table, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of existing security measures, policies, and potential risks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supplementing Evaluations with Private Investigators:</h2>



<p>As California employers gear up to comply with the new regulations, the demand for third-party investigators is expected to soar. Companies will seek the expertise of these investigators to conduct detailed assessments, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend tailored strategies to enhance workplace safety</p>



<p>While third-party investigators offer a broad assessment of workplace violence prevention programs, some California employers are taking an extra step by supplementing these evaluations with private investigators. Private investigators bring a unique skill set that extends beyond traditional workplace assessments. Their ability to conduct discreet inquiries, uncover potential internal threats, and gather information discreetly can provide an added layer of security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Competitive Edge:</h2>



<p>Employers who choose to enlist the services of private investigators in addition to third-party assessments may gain a competitive edge in safeguarding their workplaces. By adopting a proactive stance and addressing potential threats comprehensively, these businesses demonstrate a commitment to the well-being of their employees and the integrity of their operations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Considerations for Employers:</h2>



<p>California employers looking to stay ahead in the evolving landscape of workplace safety should consider the following:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Comprehensive Evaluations:</strong> Engage third-party investigators to conduct thorough evaluations of workplace violence prevention programs, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.</li>



<li><strong>Supplement with Private Investigators:</strong> Consider supplementing these evaluations with private investigators to delve deeper into potential internal threats and gather actionable intelligence.</li>



<li><strong>Proactive Security Measures:</strong> Implement recommendations from investigators promptly, adopting proactive security measures to create a robust and resilient workplace violence prevention program.</li>



<li><strong>Employee Awareness and Training:</strong> Prioritize employee awareness and training programs to ensure that staff members are equipped to identify and respond to potential threats effectively.</li>
</ol>



<p>As California forges ahead with its commitment to workplace safety through mandatory violence prevention programs, a burgeoning demand for third-party investigators becomes evident. Employers who recognize the value of supplementing these evaluations with private investigators not only enhance their security measures but also position themselves as leaders in fostering safe and secure work environments. In a landscape where workplace safety is paramount, proactive measures are the key to staying ahead and ensuring the well-being of employees. </p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a troubling and undeniable trend – workplace violence is on the rise. Incidents of aggression, harassment, and even tragic acts of violence have become more frequent, posing a significant threat to the well-being of employees across various industries. In this challenging environment, the responsibility falls squarely on leadership to go above and beyond, implementing comprehensive strategies to safeguard their employees against both internal and external risks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Internal Threats:</h2>



<p>Workplace violence is not solely an external concern; internal factors also contribute significantly to the rise in incidents. Disputes among colleagues, unresolved conflicts, and unaddressed mental health issues can create a volatile mix. Leaders must prioritize fostering a culture of open communication and conflict resolution, providing employees with channels to express concerns without fear of reprisal. Investing in employee assistance programs (EAPs) and mental health resources can further support individuals facing personal challenges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">External Threats:</h2>



<p>External threats, including acts of terrorism, theft, or even domestic violence spilling into the workplace, are on the rise. Employers must collaborate with law enforcement and security experts to conduct thorough risk assessments. Implementing access control measures, surveillance systems, and emergency response plans can help mitigate potential external threats. Additionally, providing training to employees on situational awareness and response procedures is crucial for building a resilient workforce.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Role of Leadership Against Workplace Violence:</h2>



<p>Leadership plays a pivotal role in creating a safe and secure work environment. Executives must take a proactive approach, demonstrating a commitment to the well-being of their teams. This involves not only addressing existing concerns but also anticipating potential threats and implementing preventative measures. Transparent communication about safety measures and emergency protocols fosters trust among employees and ensures they feel supported.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Investing in Technology:</h2>



<p>Advancements in technology offer powerful tools to enhance workplace security. Leaders should consider investing in state-of-the-art security systems, including access control systems, surveillance cameras, and communication platforms that enable quick dissemination of critical information during emergencies. Additionally, artificial intelligence and data analytics can be leveraged to identify patterns of behavior that may indicate a potential threat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Collaboration with Human Resources:</h2>



<p>Leadership must work closely with the Human Resources (HR) department to create and enforce policies that promote a safe and respectful workplace. HR professionals can play a crucial role in identifying early signs of potential issues, offering mediation, and providing support to employees in need. Regular training sessions on conflict resolution, diversity, and inclusion can further contribute to a positive and secure work environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving Forward Against Workplace Violence:</h2>



<p>As workplace violence continues to rise, leaders must recognize the urgency of the situation and take decisive action. Safeguarding employees requires a multifaceted approach that addresses both internal and external threats. By fostering a culture of open communication, investing in technology, collaborating with HR, and demonstrating a commitment to the well-being of their teams, leadership can create a workplace where employees feel safe, supported, and able to perform at their best without fear of violence or harassment. In these challenging times, going above and beyond to protect employees is not just a responsibility; it is an imperative for leaders aiming to build resilient, thriving organizations.</p>



<p>When appropriate, an investigation into the workplace itself may be appropriate. While the instinct to keep the investigation internal is understandable, a third-party investigator really is the best option for businesses that hope to get to the root of their repetitive issues.

<h3>Lauth Investigations is excited to share with you a series of case studies detailing the lives that our company has impacted. We’ve reached out and selected our favorite cases, this one being from the Return Assets Division. This case study is told from the perspective of Emilia Tomaszewski, a vital Claims Researcher at Lauth Investigations. For privacy reasons, names have been changed to pseudonyms.</h3></div>

The potential owner was agreeable to receiving a claim agreement for an old checking account, but he had no recollection of the address either. Throughout the research, I became close to the family and my conversations were mainly with the wife, Karen. Her husband, Eric, was suffering with prostate cancer and they were so excited about this potential windfall because they wanted to go to Las Vegas while Eric was still able to. That made me more determined to find the needed address connection.</p></div>

As a last-ditch effort, I began scouring old phone directories for the city and finally came across a last name that was identical to the claimant’s with just the letter “E” for a first name. That was close enough for me to contact Karen and I finally spoke to Eric myself. He was shocked beyond belief. It occurred to him that that was where his father lived when he was a young man and the “E” also stood for Eric for my claimant, I finally discovered, was actually a Junior.</p>
<p>With this information I was able to submit the claim to the state and it ultimately got approved. I was so excited when I heard the news and immediately called the family to congratulate them and wish them a bon voyage. Well, there was sad news when I called. Karen was crying, saying the check had come that very day but sadly enough Eric had passed away the night before.</p></div>

A very bittersweet claim that I will always remember.”</p>
<p>Although Eric never got to see Las Vegas, he passed away knowing that the love of his life would inherit the money. Our company is happy knowing that there is some comfort in that. When returning assets, we often deal with the descendants of the people holding the claim. Emilia is over the moon at the fact that she got to know Eric before he passed. </p></div>

<p>The logistics industry is the unsung hero of global commerce, ensuring the seamless movement of goods from manufacturer to consumer. However, beneath the surface of this intricate web of supply chains lies a myriad of repetitive challenges that companies consistently grapple with. </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong><ul><li>The logistics industry is highly susceptible to disruptions caused by natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and unforeseen events (hello, global pandemics!). These disruptions can lead to delays, increased costs, and a ripple effect on the entire supply chain.</li></ul><em>Solution:</em> Implementing robust risk management strategies, diversifying suppliers, and leveraging technology for real-time tracking and data analysis can help companies better anticipate and mitigate the impact of disruptions.</li>



<li><strong>Inefficient Inventory Management:</strong><ul><li>Balancing inventory levels to meet demand without overstocking or understocking is a perpetual challenge. Excess inventory ties up capital, while insufficient stock leads to missed sales opportunities and dissatisfied customers.</li></ul><em>Solution:</em> Employing advanced forecasting tools, adopting just-in-time inventory practices, and optimizing warehouse layouts can enhance inventory management efficiency.</li>



<li><strong>Technological Integration Challenges:</strong><ul><li>The logistics industry is often slow to embrace technological advancements, leading to operational inefficiencies and missed opportunities for automation and optimization.</li></ul><em>Solution:</em> Investing in cutting-edge technologies such as IoT devices, blockchain, and artificial intelligence can streamline operations, improve visibility, and enhance overall efficiency.</li>



<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance Burdens:</strong><ul><li>Navigating a web of international and domestic regulations poses a constant challenge. Non-compliance can result in fines, delays, and damage to a company&#8217;s reputation.</li></ul><em>Solution:</em> Employing compliance experts, investing in robust compliance management systems, and staying abreast of regulatory changes can help companies proactively address compliance issues.</li>



<li><strong>Transportation Costs and Sustainability:</strong><ul><li>Fluctuating fuel prices and the environmental impact of transportation are persistent concerns. Balancing cost-effectiveness with sustainability goals is a delicate tightrope walk.</li></ul><em>Solution:</em> Adopting fuel-efficient transportation modes, optimizing delivery routes, and exploring eco-friendly initiatives such as electric vehicles can help strike a balance between cost and environmental responsibility.</li>



<li><strong>Talent Shortages and Training Gaps:</strong><ul><li>The logistics industry faces a shortage of skilled workers and a widening skills gap due to the increasing complexity of logistics operations.</li></ul><em>Solution:</em> Investing in employee training programs, fostering partnerships with educational institutions, and leveraging automation to augment the workforce can help address talent shortages and bridge the skills gap.</li>
</ol>



<p>While the logistics industry is fraught with repetitive challenges, proactive and innovative approaches can transform these hurdles into opportunities for growth and efficiency.
